# Warren Acceptance Runbook

This is the operator's checklist for verifying a warren cut against the
§3.1 V1 goals + §11.A reap roundtrip + restart-recovery contract before
pushing a release.

The contract is split across **automated** (the harness in
`scripts/acceptance/`) and **manual** gates (real claude-code run, fly
deploy, UI smoke). Run the automated suite on every change; run the
manual gates before a tag.

## TL;DR

```bash
# Quality gates — same trinity CI runs.
bun test && bun run lint && bun run typecheck

# Automated acceptance harness (in-proc, default).
bun run acceptance

# Container-mode boot smoke (requires Docker, slow first run).
bun run acceptance:container
```

A green run prints something like:

```
Acceptance results:
  ✓ 01     312ms  boot + /healthz auth-exempt + /readyz transitions to 200 after refresh
  ✓ 02     842ms  POST /agents/refresh clones canopy + GET /agents lists stub-shell
  ...
  12 passed, 0 failed, 0 skipped
```

In container mode, scenarios that need host-side fixtures skip cleanly:

```
  ✓ 01     180ms  boot + /healthz auth-exempt + /readyz transitions to 200 after refresh
  ○ 02       0ms  POST /agents/refresh clones canopy + GET /agents lists stub-shell
        ↳ not supported in container mode
  ...
  ✓ 13   42130ms  container boot — image builds, supervisor + bwrap flags hold, healthz/readyz/agents respond
  2 passed, 0 failed, 11 skipped
```

## Quality gates (CI parity)

CI (`.github/workflows/release.yml`) runs the same three commands; if
any fails locally, your push will fail there too.

```bash
bun test                     # 489+ tests across 50 files
bun run lint                 # biome check --error-on-warnings .
bun run typecheck            # tsc --noEmit
```

Biome enforces `scripts/acceptance/` (per d7a788e). Warnings count as
failures (`--error-on-warnings`); fix at write time, don't suppress.
Release wiring (`.github/workflows/release.yml`) auto-tags `v$VERSION`
and cuts a GitHub release on every push to `main` where
`package.json` + `src/index.ts` agree on a new version. **The harness
must be green before bumping VERSION** or a broken release ships
unattended.

## Automated harness — in-proc mode

Default mode. Boots `bun run src/server/main.ts` + `burrow serve` as
sibling processes on a temp dir, builds local git fixtures via the
`GIT_CONFIG_GLOBAL` insteadOf rewrite (no network), and exercises every
HTTP route end-to-end. No Docker, no API keys, ~30s wall-clock.

```bash
bun run acceptance                          # all scenarios
bun run scripts/acceptance/run.ts --only 04,05  # one or more by id
bun run scripts/acceptance/run.ts --stop-on-failure
bun run scripts/acceptance/run.ts --keep-tmp     # leave fixtures for inspection
```

Logging knobs:

| env                                | effect                                        |
|------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| `WARREN_ACCEPTANCE_LOG_LEVEL=debug`| verbose harness logs                          |
| `WARREN_ACCEPTANCE_WARREN_STDOUT=1`| passthrough warren server stdout              |
| `WARREN_ACCEPTANCE_WARREN_STDERR=1`| passthrough warren server stderr              |
| `WARREN_ACCEPTANCE_BURROW_STDOUT=1`| passthrough burrow stdout                     |
| `WARREN_ACCEPTANCE_BURROW_STDERR=1`| passthrough burrow stderr                     |

In-proc mode covers scenarios 01–12 (the §3.1 application contract).

## Automated harness — container mode

Boots warren via `docker compose up -d --build` using the canonical
`docker-compose.yml` plus a generated override that:

- gives the run a unique compose project name + container name,
- maps a random ephemeral host port to the container's `:8080`,
- supplies `WARREN_API_TOKEN`, `WARREN_BURROW_NO_AUTH=1`,
  `WARREN_LOG_LEVEL=warn`, and an empty `CANOPY_REPO_URL` inline
  (no `.env` file required at the repo root).

```bash
bun run acceptance:container
# or, equivalently:
bun run scripts/acceptance/run.ts --mode container
```

Container mode requires Docker on PATH and a running daemon. First run
builds the image (~1–3 min on a warm cache); subsequent runs reuse the
image layer and complete the boot smoke in ~30s.

What container mode actually verifies (scenarios 01 + 13):

- the image builds (ui-builder + runtime stages),
- the supervisor (`bun run src/supervisor/main.ts`) boots burrow under
  the four bwrap-friendly security flags from `docker-compose.yml`
  (apparmor=unconfined, seccomp=unconfined, systempaths=unconfined,
  cap_add=SYS_ADMIN),
- warren and burrow start as siblings on `/var/run/burrow.sock`,
- `/healthz` is auth-exempt and returns 200,
- `GET /agents` returns the two built-in agents (`claude-code`,
  `sapling`) seeded by `seedBuiltinAgents`,
- `/readyz` returns a structured `{ ok, checks: [...] }` body.

Scenarios that depend on host-side fixtures (canopy library, sample
project repo) declare `modes: ["in-proc"]` and skip cleanly in
container mode — the compose harness deliberately doesn't bind-mount
fixtures into the container, since the production deploy is
fixture-free. Scenarios that drive process control (kill warren /
restart warren / kill burrow) also stay in-proc-only because the
in-container supervisor owns burrow lifecycle and would fight
harness-side kills.

**macOS Docker Desktop caveat.** Container boot succeeds on macOS, but
`cap_add: SYS_ADMIN` is partial under Docker Desktop's VM. Boot smoke
(scenario 13) holds; dispatching a real run with bwrap nesting is
Linux-only territory and is not asserted here. For nested-bwrap
verification, run `acceptance:container` on a Linux host or treat the
fly deploy gate (below) as the bwrap-nesting check.

**`--keep-tmp` in container mode** leaves the compose stack running
after the harness exits. Tear it down with the printed command:

```
docker compose -p warren-acceptance-<suffix> down -v
```

## Manual gate — `--real` claude-code run

Verifies the §11.E first-run path: a real claude-code run, with a real
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY, against a real GitHub repo, completes end-to-end
with `state: succeeded` + `branchPushed: true` + non-zero `commitsAhead`.

`--real` is a documented opt-in flag on `scripts/acceptance/run.ts`,
but no `--real` scenario is implemented today (token cost + flakiness
risk). Drive the gate manually instead, against a long-lived dev
instance of warren:

```bash
# 1. Make sure your local stack is up (compose or `bun run src/server/main.ts`)
#    and ANTHROPIC_API_KEY + GITHUB_TOKEN are set.

# 2. Register a real project (a writeable repo you control, like a sandbox fork).
warren add-project https://github.com/<you>/<sandbox-repo>.git

# 3. Spawn a claude-code run with a small, scoped prompt.
warren run claude-code <project-name> -p "Add a one-line CHANGELOG entry under [Unreleased] about the V1 acceptance gate. Commit when done."

# 4. Watch the run in the UI (http://localhost:8080) or via:
warren events <run-id> --follow
```

**Pass criteria.**
- Run reaches `state: succeeded` (terminal).
- `runRow.branchPushed === true`.
- `gh compare main...burrow/<bur-id>` reports `ahead_by ≥ 1` and the
  diff matches the prompt's intent.
- Reap fired `mulch.record.added`/`updated`/`skipped` events for any
  records the agent recorded inside the sandbox; project's persistent
  `.mulch/` carries the post-merge state.

If any of the above fail, do **not** ship — the §4.3 composition flow
is structurally broken in a way the automated harness can't catch
(stub agent has no real toolchain). Re-read the §11.E–§11.G
post-mortems in `SPEC.md` for the canonical failure shapes
(`warren-67cc`, `warren-a69a`, `warren-1eaa`, `warren-1a09`, etc.) and
`branchPushed-requires-both-reap-and-sandbox-git` (a `branchPushed:
true` does NOT prove the agent committed — it can fire on an
empty-push, surfaced by the `reap.empty_push` event when
`commitsAhead: 0`).

## Manual gate — Fly deploy

Verifies the §10.2 deploy shape on a real Firecracker VM (the only
runtime where bwrap nests without any of the docker-compose flags).
This is the fly.io equivalent of "did the canonical home-server deploy
just work."

```bash
# First-time setup (already in fly.toml's header comment):
fly launch                                       # reads fly.toml
fly volumes create warren_data --size 50 --region sjc
BURROW_TOKEN=$(openssl rand -hex 32)
fly secrets set \
    WARREN_API_TOKEN=$(openssl rand -hex 32) \
    BURROW_API_TOKEN=$BURROW_TOKEN \
    WARREN_BURROW_TOKEN=$BURROW_TOKEN \
    CANOPY_REPO_URL=https://github.com/<you>/agents.git \
    ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=... \
    GITHUB_TOKEN=...

# Each release:
fly deploy                                       # bumps the Machine
fly logs                                         # watch supervisor + warren + burrow boot
curl -fsS https://<app>.fly.dev/healthz          # 200 expected
curl -fsS https://<app>.fly.dev/readyz \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $WARREN_API_TOKEN"  # 200 expected
```

**Pass criteria.**
- `fly deploy` completes without health-check timeouts.
- `/healthz` returns 200, `/readyz` returns 200 with all probes ok.
- `fly logs` show:
  - supervisor's `installGitCredentials()` boot-time line (mx-4d7d5d);
  - burrow socket bound;
  - warren `/healthz responding`.
- A real claude-code run (per the `--real` gate above) completes end-to-end.

The four `bwrap`-required flags (`apparmor=unconfined`,
`seccomp=unconfined`, `systempaths=unconfined`, `cap_add=SYS_ADMIN`)
are NOT in fly.toml — Fly Machines are Firecracker VMs, not containers,
and bwrap nests on a stock Machine kernel. See `fly.toml` line 88+ for
the rationale and `burrow/DEPLOY.md` for the upstream recipe.

## Manual gate — UI smoke

The acceptance harness drives the HTTP API exclusively. The UI
(`src/ui/`) is a separate Vite/React SPA that's bundled into the
runtime image at build time; the only way to catch UI regressions is
to look at it.

Two surfaces to drive against your local stack (or the deployed
warren):

```bash
# Local stack (in-proc):
bun run src/server/main.ts &
bun run ui:dev                      # vite at http://localhost:5173

# Or the bundled UI (what production serves at :8080):
bun run build:ui
bun run src/server/main.ts          # serves UI from src/ui/dist
open http://localhost:8080
```

**Walkthrough — golden path.**

1. **Login screen.** Paste `WARREN_API_TOKEN` into the bearer-token
   input (stored in localStorage under `warren.apiToken`). The
   ProjectsPage should load without redirecting back to login.
2. **Agents page.** Built-in agents (`claude-code`, `sapling`) appear
   with a `builtin` badge. If `CANOPY_REPO_URL` is set, library agents
   appear after a refresh.
3. **Projects page.** `Add project` accepts a github.com URL and
   produces a row within ~5s; refresh updates `defaultBranch`.
4. **New run.** Pick agent + project, type a prompt, submit. The page
   redirects to RunDetail; the event tail flows in real time and the
   header badge transitions queued → running → succeeded.
5. **RunDetail page.** Steer form sends a body that appears as a
   `steer.sent` audit event. Cancel button transitions the run to
   `cancelled`. The post-reap header carries either a `+N commits`
   badge or an `empty push` warning (mx-6aae24); a real-claude-code
   run also surfaces a `PR ↗` link if `WARREN_AUTO_OPEN_PR` is on
   (mx-f0f743).

**Walkthrough — regressions to watch for.**

- Wide tables (Projects, Runs) push the layout past 100vw → fix the
  `min-w-0` on the flex `<main>` (mx-a8a1df).
- RunDetail badge stale after reap → check the events subscription is
  still wired (warren-d9ad).
- Empty-push warning fires on a real-work run → the agent didn't
  commit (warren-f3bb / `branchPushed-requires-both-reap-and-sandbox-git`).

## Known V1 caveats (SPEC §11)

These don't fail acceptance but are footguns when interpreting
results:

- **`warren` CLI is not on the in-container PATH** for scenarios that
  shell `warren <cmd>` from the host (warren-fab1). Container-mode
  scenarios that need the CLI use `bun /app/src/cli/main.ts <cmd>`
  via `docker exec` instead of relying on PATH symlinks. The Dockerfile
  does symlink `/usr/local/bin/warren`, but the harness doesn't
  `docker exec` into the container — scenarios that need the CLI
  declare `modes: ["in-proc"]`.
- **Supervisor `--no-auth` knob is via env, not flag** (warren-93ee
  closed; mx-24f580). Container mode sets `WARREN_BURROW_NO_AUTH=1`
  in the override env block.
- **Runtime image installs curl** (mx-4c4bee) — first-run diagnostics
  inside the container can shell `curl http://127.0.0.1:8080/healthz`
  directly without the `bun -e fetch(...)` workaround the original
  warren-bd69 issue described.
- **macOS Docker Desktop nests bwrap partially** — see container-mode
  caveat above.

When adding a scenario, mirror the existing file shape: a top-level
JSDoc with the criterion + verification surface, an exported `Scenario`
constant with `id`, `title`, `modes`, and an async `run(ctx)`. Use
`WarrenHttp` for HTTP, `assertEqual`/`assertTrue` for asserts, and
`AcceptanceError` for thrown failures so the runner's table shows the
message verbatim.
