# Warren Project Philosophy

**Coding agents are tools. Warren turns them into infrastructure.** An
agent invocation becomes a managed workload with an isolated workspace,
a durable lifecycle, limits, events, intervention, recovery, and Git
delivery. The operator owns the compute, credentials, and run history.

Warren ships that infrastructure as a minimal, extensible kernel. This
document holds policy only: the rules that stay true for years. For
direction, sequencing, and seam status, read [ROADMAP.md](../ROADMAP.md).
For the work queue, run `sd ready`. A sentence here that names temporary
code state is a bug in this document.

## The kernel

The irreducible core is:

> **project registry → dispatch → sandboxed run → event stream →
> steer/pause → reap → push branch**

plus the HTTP API, the UI shell, and storage. That is all.

A control plane carries more state than a CLI — runs, projects, events,
auth. So "minimal" here means *minimal surface, few nouns*, not few
lines. The kernel's guaranteed output is a pushed workspace branch.
Everything past that point — open a PR, close an issue, sync a tracker —
is extension behavior.

The litmus test for core membership:

> If a feature observes or reacts to the run lifecycle, it is an
> extension.

Removal of a feature must mean *not loading it*, never surgery.

## The pi.dev discipline

Pi proves that disciplined subtraction and interceptable lifecycle
boundaries can produce a small core without producing a closed system.
Its maintainers left sub-agents, plan mode, and sandboxing out of core,
then shipped extensions to prove the extension API could carry them.
"Adapt Pi to your workflows, not the other way around."

Warren applies that architecture discipline to agent infrastructure.
The aspiration is to be the [pi.dev](https://pi.dev/) of software
factories: a legible orchestration kernel where swappable nouns sit
behind contracts and run-lifecycle reactions stay outside core. The
run loop is the product kernel; the contracts keep it adaptable.

## Seams

A seam is a swappable noun. Every seam gets a contract, a registry, and
at least two implementations. The house style, set by `RuntimeProvider`
and the storage dialect layer:

- Provider-neutral DTOs. A contract type never names a first-party
  feature.
- Capability flags, which the domain reads before it acts.
- One registry, selected by env or config, resolved once at boot.
- Unknown selections fail loudly at boot. No silent fallback.
- A falsification test, written before the contract: name the change
  that proves the seam failed.
- A lint gate that fails on a boundary-crossing import, landed in the
  same PR as the contract.

[ROADMAP.md](../ROADMAP.md) owns the list of seams, their status, and
the feature that pays for each one. Each cut seam gets a contract
document under `docs/design/`, modeled on
`docs/design/runtime-provider-contract.md`.

## Extension tiers

Who wrote the code determines which mechanism carries it. Three tiers,
split by trust, cheapest first. The first tier is always the first
answer to "where does my custom integration code live":

- **Tier 0 — in-repo skills.** Most integrations need no warren surface
  at all: CLI tools plus a README or AGENTS.md in the project's own
  repo, invoked by the agent inside the sandbox, paid for only when
  used. A team's AWS, S3, or deploy tooling lives here first.
- **Tier 1 — container plugins (intended mechanism).** Run-adjacent
  custom code belongs in a container with an env contract (the
  Woodpecker CI model). The target shape lets Warren invoke the team's
  image at a lifecycle stage with `WARREN_RUN_ID` and `PLUGIN_*` env
  vars. This general loader has not shipped. Current out-of-process
  observers consume the published HTTP and event surfaces instead.
- **Tier 2 — operator hooks (policy, not a shipped loader).** In-process
  TypeScript loaded at boot from deployment config is reserved for the
  person who owns the deployment. Third-party code never runs inside
  the server process. Warren does not yet ship a general Tier 2 hook
  loader.

When a general hook contract ships, it is versioned from day one
(`warren-ext/v1` in every payload, negotiated at handshake,
Terraform-style). A breaking change deprecates into a compat shim before
removal. A declared hook that never fires is a contract that lies. Emit
it, or mark it reserved in the design document and in the code.

Every refusal to add a feature to core gets a public "deliberately not
in core" entry in ROADMAP.md, with a recipe that names the tier that
carries it.

## Operating rules

1. **Features pay for seams.** Do not cut a seam on speculation. Cut it
   when a second implementation forces it. To build the feature without
   the seam deepens coupling that must then be un-deepened. Order
   matters.
2. **First-party features must be expressible as extensions.** If a
   first-party feature cannot be rebuilt on the extension API, the API
   is not good enough yet. We eat our own constraint, like pi shipping
   sub-agents as an extension.
3. **`ServerDeps` only shrinks.** The dep bag is the anti-pattern this
   policy exists to kill. A new capability registers through a seam. It
   does not add a field. (Twelve plot-specific injector fields is the
   cautionary tale.)
4. **A seam is not done until a gate enforces it.** The definition of
   done for any eviction is a lint or check gate that fails on a
   boundary-crossing import — not a clean grep on one day. The same
   standard applies to behavior claims: a capability parity that only a
   grep supports is not done either.
5. **Data formats are API.** The JSONL run-event stream, the events
   table, the OpenAPI surface — machine-readable at every boundary.
   Out-of-process integrations build on these before any in-process
   plugin API exists.
6. **The extension API is versioned from day one, and stays read-only
   as long as possible.** Warren extensions will be load-bearing in
   other people's deployments. API churn is the failure mode that kills
   server-side plugin ecosystems. Observation hooks come first.
   Mutating hooks come only when a real extension needs them.
7. **Capabilities, not conditionals.** Runtime-specific or
   integration-specific behavior gates on declared capability flags,
   not on `hasPlot`-style booleans scattered through handlers, and not
   on directory probes. A capability is declared by the provider and
   read by the domain.
8. **Unused features are deleted, not re-platformed.** Rule 2 applies
   to features that earn their keep. A feature with no users cannot pay
   for a seam (rule 1). To build extension API for it is speculation in
   a discipline costume. Delete it and keep the door open — a deleted
   feature can return as an extension when someone wants it enough to
   pay for the API it needs. Deletion is the honest form of
   subtraction. Pi's minimalism began with what it left out.

## Anti-goals

Things warren does not build into core, each with its escape hatch:

- **No general workflow engine.** Plan-runs are a narrow dispatch mode
  over an ordered work list with a merge gate. Broader campaigns,
  chat-shaped workflows, and organization policy stay outside core.
- **No forge monoculture.** The kernel's contract with the world is a
  pushed branch. GitHub is implementation #1 behind the live `Forge`
  seam, never an assumption in domain code.
- **No issue-tracker monoculture.** Seeds is implementation #1 behind
  the live `IssueTracker` seam, never a structural dependency.
- **No agent-runtime semantics in the sandbox layer.** Warren's sandbox
  starts a command and transports its output. What a Claude Code or Pi
  event means belongs to `AgentRuntimeAdapter`.
- **No in-core integration sprawl.** Slack, Sentry, and Grafana arrive
  as extensions on the event bus, never as new `ServerDeps` fields.
- **No multi-tenant SaaS.** One warren deploy serves one team. Seams
  declare a single-org scope explicitly.

## Where state lives

This file changes when the policy changes, and at no other time.

| Question | Source of truth |
|---|---|
| What is the policy? | This file |
| What is the direction and the order of work? | [ROADMAP.md](../ROADMAP.md) |
| What is the status of a seam? | ROADMAP.md seam table |
| What is the design of a cut seam? | `docs/design/*.md` |
| What work is open? | `sd ready` |
| What did we learn? | `ml prime` |

Warren becomes the pi.dev of software factories by accretion of
discipline — which is also how pi did it.
