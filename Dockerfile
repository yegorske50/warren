# Warren container image (SPEC §10.3).
#
# Two-stage build:
#   1. ui-builder — build the React/Vite SPA into src/ui/dist.
#   2. runtime    — bun + bwrap + uidmap, warren source, burrow itself
#                   plus the bundled os-eco CLIs warren shells out to for
#                   opt-in features (canopy/mulch/seeds/sapling), and the
#                   SPA bundle copied from stage 1.
#
# The supervisor (src/supervisor/main.ts) is the ENTRYPOINT — it owns
# spawning + signal-forwarding + restart policy for `burrow serve` and
# warren's HTTP server. See SPEC §10.3 for the contract.
#
# The four `bwrap` security flags (apparmor=unconfined, seccomp=unconfined,
# systempaths=unconfined, cap_add=SYS_ADMIN) are applied by the orchestrator
# (docker-compose.yml or fly.toml), not the image. See SPEC §5.3 + §11.A
# and burrow's DEPLOY.md for the rationale.

# bubblewrap is the sandbox primitive burrow uses (see burrow DEPLOY.md);
# uidmap provides newuidmap/newgidmap for the userns nesting. ca-certificates
# is needed by git over https. curl is kept around for first-run diagnostics
# against the burrow socket (saves having to bun -e fetch() workarounds).
#
# nodejs (real Node, not the bun-shim) is required by preview sidecars
# (warren-a82b): per-run JS dev servers (`pnpm dev`, `npm run dev`, `next`,
# `vite`, etc.) shell out through node_modules/.bin/* shell stubs whose
# shebang is `#!/usr/bin/env node`. Until this layer landed, that resolved
# to a bun-shim symlink installed below for pi compat, and Bun's built-in
# module coverage drift (e.g. missing `node:sqlite` on v1.2.23) crashed any
# Next.js / Remix project on startup. NodeSource ships a recent LTS — bookworm's
# stock `nodejs` package is too old (18.19) for current frontend stacks.
#
# netcat-openbsd is required by burrow's inbound port-forwarder (SPEC §8.7,
# `../burrow/src/provider/local/inbound-forward.ts`): the forwarder accepts
# host-loopback connections and `nsenter`s into the burrow netns to relay
# via `nc 127.0.0.1 <sandboxPort>`. Without it, every accepted connection's
# relay spawn fails, the host socket gets terminated, and any client (the
# warren readiness probe in particular) just sees connection drops until
# the deadline. Diagnosed against run_t688fe74n1ts (jayminwest.com) where
# `next dev -H 0.0.0.0` was finally binding on `0.0.0.0:3000` inside the
# netns but the 5m probe still failed because the relay never spawned.

# Bundled CLIs warren shells out to during run setup, reap, and project
# management, plus burrow itself (the supervisor execs `burrow serve`).
# The four os-eco CLIs (canopy/seeds/mulch/sapling) back warren's opt-in
# features — they ship in every image so the features light up the moment
# a project or operator opts in, with no separate install. Versions track
# each tool's current release; bumping them is a deliberate image-rebuild
# decision.
#
# pnpm is baked in so per-run preview sidecars (R-19 / SPEC §11.L) can
# boot the common JS dev-server commands (`pnpm dev`) in projects that
# don't use bun. npm ships with the NodeSource `nodejs` package above,
# so we don't reinstall it via bun. Both run under the real Node installed
# in the apt layer (warren-a82b) — not the bun-shim — so any Node built-in
# module a project's deps reach for resolves correctly.
#
# BUN_INSTALL=/usr/local relocates the global package store from the default
# /root/.bun/install/global into /usr/local/install/global. Burrow's bwrap
# profile only ro-binds /usr, /etc, /lib, /lib64, /bin, /sbin, /opt (see
# burrow src/provider/local/bwrap.ts SYSTEM_RO_MOUNTS) — /root is not visible
# inside the sandbox, so symlinks at /usr/local/bin/{sd,ml,cn,sapling,burrow}
# pointing into /root/.bun would dangle for the UID-1000 agent (warren-1eaa).
# /usr/local sits under /usr so the symlink targets resolve inside the sandbox.
