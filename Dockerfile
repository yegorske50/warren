# Warren container image (SPEC §10.3).
#
# Two-stage build:
#   1. ui-builder — build the React/Vite SPA into src/ui/dist.
#   2. runtime    — bun + bwrap + uidmap, warren source, the four os-eco
#                   CLIs warren shells out to plus burrow itself, and the
#                   SPA bundle copied from stage 1.
#
# The supervisor (src/supervisor/main.ts) is the ENTRYPOINT — it owns
# spawning + signal-forwarding + restart policy for `burrow serve` and
# warren's HTTP server. See SPEC §10.3 for the contract.
#
# The four `bwrap` security flags (apparmor=unconfined, seccomp=unconfined,
# systempaths=unconfined, cap_add=SYS_ADMIN) are applied by the orchestrator
# (docker-compose.yml or fly.toml), not the image. See SPEC §5.3 + §11.A
# and burrow's DEPLOY.md for the rationale.

# profile only ro-binds /usr, /etc, /lib, /lib64, /bin, /sbin, /opt (see
# burrow src/provider/local/bwrap.ts SYSTEM_RO_MOUNTS) — /root is not visible
# inside the sandbox, so symlinks at /usr/local/bin/{sd,ml,cn,sapling,burrow}
# pointing into /root/.bun would dangle for the UID-1000 agent (warren-1eaa).
# /usr/local sits under /usr so the symlink targets resolve inside the sandbox.
