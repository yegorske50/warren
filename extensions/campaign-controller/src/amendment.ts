/**
 * The manifest amendment flow (plan pl-096b step 3, warren-35c4).
 *
 * Every manifest edit used to create a full new campaign row and an
 * unresolved `superseded_by_new_manifest_version` attention item, so a live
 * campaign iterating on prompt or budget burned a row per edit. An
 * amendment is the bounded alternative: a document that references the
 * campaign and its base manifest digest, carries ONLY the changed fields,
 * and is digest-bound and owner-approved exactly like a manifest — the
 * approval authority never weakens.
 *
 * Amendable fields (the manifest's operator-tunable knobs):
 *   - `appendIssues`    — issues added at the END of the ordered list
 *   - `budget`          — full replacement of the layered caps
 *   - `prompt`/`promptDigest` — replacement dispatch prompt (exactly one)
 *   - `maxConcurrentRuns`
 *   - `expiresAt`       — expiry extension
 *
 * Out of scope by construction: removing or reordering existing issues
 * (an amendment cannot express either; appending an already-present issue
 * is refused with an actionable error) and mutation-flag changes (those
 * live in the repository-policy snapshot, which has its own digest and
 * re-approval path — see `repository-policy.ts`).
 *
 * On approval the controller applies the amendment as a new campaign
 * version IN PLACE: same campaign row id, `campaignVersion` incremented,
 * the amendment journaled append-only, no superseded attention row.
 *
 * Deterministic policy for prior in-flight intents of the old version:
 * actions still in `planned` state (an intent committed but whose I/O has
 * not started) are INVALIDATED — settled `permanent_failure` with
 * `policy_violation`, their active reservations released, since the old
 * approval no longer authorizes them. Actions already `executing` are left
 * alone: their I/O is in flight and the dispatcher's reconcile path owns
 * them. Work items in post-dispatch states are never rewound.
