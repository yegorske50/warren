/**
 * The warren-tracker/v1 wire protocol, base-contract subset.
 *
 * PUBLISHED VOCABULARY COPY. The extension seam
 * (docs/design/extensions.md) forbids importing warren internals, so this
 * is a deliberate copy of the published declaration that ships with
 * `@warren-ext/tracker-conformance` (`src/protocol.ts`), which is itself
 * the extension-side mirror of warren's canonical
 * `src/tracker/remote/protocol.ts`. The conformance suite is what holds
 * all three to the same behavior, so run it after touching this file.
 *
 * Only the base contract lives here. This tracker declares
 * `supportsPlans`, `supportsMetadata` and `supportsScheduledIssues` all
 * false, and warren never calls a surface whose capability was not
 * declared, so copying the plan, metadata and scheduled-issue shapes
 * would be copying vocabulary this package cannot speak.
