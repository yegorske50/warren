/**
 * Scenario 39 — public-instance exposure guard (warren-c405 / pl-b82d step 21).
 *
 * The regression guard that makes the public-instance phase durable. Every
 * projection pl-b82d landed is an ALLOWLIST a future contributor can widen
 * by accident, and a one-day-clean grep is not a gate — so this scenario
 * drives a real `WARREN_AUTH=public` stack and asserts, end to end:
 *
 *   1. No blocked route answers 200 anonymously (401/403 only), enumerated
 *      from `API_ROUTE_POLICIES` so a newly-added blocked route is covered
 *      automatically.
 *   2. Every mutating route (POST / DELETE) is refused anonymously.
 *   3. `GET /runs/:id/inbox` does not drain the operator's steering queue —
 *      the operator's own poll afterwards still finds the message.
 *   4. No anonymous response body carries a redacted field name, a planted
 *      sentinel value, a host path, or a live bearer credential.
 *   5. A forced 500 narrates nothing (warren-4385).
 *   6. Exceeding the per-client event-stream cap is a 503 (warren-25f6),
 *      rotating the client-controlled LEFT-most `X-Forwarded-For` hop does
 *      not dodge it (warren-46a7), and neither does spreading streams
 *      across client keys past the GLOBAL cap (warren-b0bd).
 *   7. Anonymous reads are bounded: `GET /runs?limit=` is clamp-refused
 *      past 500 (warren-ee50) and an event replay is one bounded page the
 *      client pages beyond with `?since` (warren-2a8b) — never the whole
 *      transcript in one shot.
 *   8. The pre-auth preview-proxy preamble narrates nothing: cookie
 *      verification precedes any run lookup (warren-820e), so an
 *      anonymous caller — runId known, unknown, or remote — sees one
 *      uniform 401 and the R-12 501 never leaks the redacted
 *      `workerId`; the warren-e2a4 security headers still reach its
 *      below-the-gate envelopes (warren-b0bd).
 *   9. Fail-closed: token mode grants anonymity nothing, an unrecognized
 *      `WARREN_AUTH` refuses the boot, and public mode refuses to boot with
 *      an empty or non-matching org allowlist (warren-851b / warren-ce9b).
 *
 * Self-contained by construction: it boots its OWN warren on its OWN temp
 * root with a database seeded through warren's repos before boot (see
 * `39-public-exposure.helpers.ts`), so it needs no burrow dispatch, no
 * canopy CLI and no LLM — which is what makes it cheap enough to run in CI
 * (`.github/workflows/acceptance-public.yml`).
