# Emits pi RPC stdout JSONL (matching pi v0.74.0 — see burrow
# src/runtime/parsers/__golden__/pi-v0.74.0-anthropic-success.jsonl).
# burrow-with-stub.ts registers a custom AgentRuntime for the `pi` id
# whose parseEvents reads parsePiEvents, so each line below lands as a
# state_change/telemetry event in burrow's event stream and flows through
# warren's bridge. The `turn_end` envelope carries `message.usage.cost.total`
# + token counts, which warren's accumulatePiUsage (src/runs/stream/bridge.ts)
# extracts and persists into runs.cost_usd / tokens_input / tokens_output
# when it sees the `agent_end` envelope (warren-17a4).
#
# This script is the third unblock-path from the warren-17a4 seed
# update: bypass declarative outputFormats entirely by giving burrow
# a custom runtime whose parser is the real parsePiEvents.
