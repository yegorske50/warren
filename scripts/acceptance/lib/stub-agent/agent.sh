# Deterministic stub agent for warren's acceptance harness.
#
# Burrow dispatches us via the [[agents]] declaration in the sample
# project's burrow.toml (id = "stub-shell", command = this script).
#
# Three side effects, in order:
#   1. Append a known mulch record to .mulch/expertise/<domain>.jsonl
#      with a recorded_at timestamp warren's reap step (§11.A LWW)
#      uses to merge into the project's persistent .mulch/.
#   2. Mark the harness's known seed as `closed` in .seeds/issues.jsonl
#      so reap's seeds-close-mirror sub-step has something to mirror.
#   3. Emit a few stdout lines so warren's events table has events
#      to persist + replay.
#
# Inputs the harness controls via env:
#   WARREN_STUB_MULCH_DOMAIN   domain bucket the stub appends to
#   WARREN_STUB_MULCH_ID       stable record id (so LWW conflict resolution
#                              has something to compare against)
#   WARREN_STUB_SEED_ID        seed id the agent should mark closed
#   WARREN_STUB_SLEEP_MS       sleep before exit (lets the stream-recovery
#                              scenario kill warren mid-run); default 0
#
# Workspace layout (per burrow conventions): we are cd'd into the burrow
# workspace root; .mulch/ and .seeds/ are seeded by warren before we run.
