/**
 * Fixture builder for the acceptance harness.
 *
 * Builds two on-disk git repos warren can clone, plus a `git-config`
 * file that rewrites their fake `https://github.com/...` URLs to local
 * paths via `[url "...".insteadOf]`. Setting `GIT_CONFIG_GLOBAL` to
 * that file (the in-proc launcher already does) makes warren's
 * `git clone https://github.com/warren-acceptance/sample.git` resolve
 * to the local fixture transparently — no network, no production code
 * change to warren's URL parser.
 *
 * The canopy library is built by shelling to the `cn` CLI installed on
 * the harness's PATH. That keeps the schema authored by canopy itself,
 * so a canopy version bump doesn't silently break the fixture.
 *
 * The sample project carries:
 *   - `burrow.toml` — declares the `stub-shell` agent (SPEC §12.3
 *     declarative AgentConfig) pointing at the bash script the harness
 *     runs on every dispatch.
 *   - `tools/stub-agent.sh` — the deterministic stub committed via
 *     scripts/acceptance/lib/stub-agent/agent.sh.
 *   - `README.md` — so `git commit` has at least one tracked file
 *     warren's git clone can resolve a default branch from.
 *
 * Cleanup: the in-proc launcher removes `tmpRoot` recursively on stop.
 * Builders here just write files; lifecycle is the launcher's problem.
