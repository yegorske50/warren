> A network of interconnected burrows. Agents that operate in isolation, self-manage, self-repair, and self-improve.

Warren is a self-hostable control plane for ephemeral coding agents. Runs are short-lived and sandboxed: they complete a task, validate the changes, push a branch, and spin down. Point it at your repos, dispatch from a browser or CLI, watch the events stream live, and reap the result. **One container, one volume, one HTTP API, one UI.**

A fresh install needs nothing but a GitHub URL and a prompt. The built-in `claude-code` agent ships inline; pick it, paste your repo, write what you want done. Power features (versioned prompt libraries, persistent agent memory, an integrated issue queue, a steerable alternative harness, a shared coordination substrate) light up when you opt into them.

## Who this is for

Engineering teams self-hosting their own agent infrastructure. The deployment unit is one team or one org running one warren on their own box, their own Fly account, or their own cluster. Run it for yourself on a home server today; the [org-readiness roadmap](ROADMAP.md) extends the same architecture to a 50+ engineer organization without forcing a fork.

## Status

Stable (`0.6.2`), running on Fly.io in continuous use against real GitHub repos. The end-to-end path is covered by 33 scenario-based acceptance tests in [`scripts/acceptance/`](scripts/acceptance/): manual runs, cron triggers, multi-worker placement, Postgres backend, per-run preview environments, restart recovery, cost tracking, cost analytics, seeds-extensions roundtrip, serial plan-run dispatch, plan-run + Plot composition, Plot-workbench loop. The active frontier is the org-readiness cluster: SSO, remote workers, MCP, audit, budgets, GitHub App auth. See [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md).

## What you get

- **One image, one volume.** The supervisor (`src/supervisor/main.ts`) is the container ENTRYPOINT. It spawns the sandbox runtime first, waits for the unix socket, then spawns warren. SIGTERM/SIGINT forward to both children; the runtime restarts under a 5-in-60s budget on unexpected exit.
- **Native sandboxing per run.** Every run gets a fresh `bwrap`-isolated workspace under `/data/burrow/`. The host is unreachable; warren talks to the runtime over a unix socket with a shared bearer token.
- **Built-in agents.** `claude-code`, `sapling`, and `pi` ship inline (`src/registry/builtins/`), so dispatching a run needs no extra setup.
- **Live event stream.** NDJSON events are persisted to warren's SQLite log and tailed over `GET /runs/:id/events?follow=1`. The UI, CLI (`warren run`), and HTTP clients all consume the same stream.
- **Steerable mid-run.** `POST /runs/:id/steer` lands a message in the agent's inbox; the next turn picks it up. `POST /runs/:id/cancel` aborts cleanly.
- **Scheduled runs.** `.warren/triggers.yaml` defines cron triggers per project; the in-process scheduler dispatches them on the same composition path as manual runs.
- **Serial plan-run dispatch.** Projects shipping `.seeds/` can `POST /plan-runs` against a seeds plan; warren walks the plan's children one at a time, spawning one run per child and gating each on the previous PR merging before the next dispatches. Re-dispatching the same plan after some children have closed resumes from the next open child.
- **Workspace UI on opt-in deployments.** When any project ships `.plot/` and at least one Plot exists, warren's default landing flips to `/workspace` and the sidebar collapses Leveret + Plots into a single **Workspace** entry; the standalone path (no `.plot/` projects) stays byte-identical with `/runs` as the index. The Workspace list shows one row per Plot (the durable spine), and the `/workspace/:id` detail page walks the whole flow across tabs — **Shape** (conversation with the Leveret overseer + structured intent editor), **Plan** (planner run + sign-off gate that arms dispatch), **Run** (serial plan-run execution with per-child PR-merge status), and **Activity** (unified Plot event log + substrate). Human and agent events share one timeline with inline answer-cards on open questions. See [SPEC §11.O.Plot.UI](SPEC.md#11oplotui-plot-centric-ui-surface-pl-9d6a-2026-05-18).
- **Three thin clients of one pipeline.** Web UI, `warren` admin CLI, and HTTP API all flow through the same composition path ([SPEC §4.3](SPEC.md#43-the-composition-flow)).

## Quickstart (home server)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jayminwest/warren && cd warren
cp .env.example .env && $EDITOR .env
docker compose up -d
open http://localhost:8080
```

Paste your `WARREN_API_TOKEN`, click **Projects → Add**, give it a GitHub URL. Then **Dispatch run**, pick `claude-code`, write a prompt, hit go. The events panel streams; when the run completes warren pushes a branch you can open a PR from.

Required environment variables (see [`.env.example`](.env.example) for the full list):

| Variable | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `WARREN_API_TOKEN` | Bearer token on every route except `/healthz`. `openssl rand -hex 32`. |
| `BURROW_API_TOKEN` | Token the sandbox runtime requires to bind. `openssl rand -hex 32`. |
| `WARREN_BURROW_TOKEN` | Token warren's runtime client sends. **Must equal `BURROW_API_TOKEN`**; they are the two ends of one channel. |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | Forwarded to agent runtimes that need it. |
| `GITHUB_TOKEN` | Forwarded for project clones + branch pushes. |

The compose file applies the four bwrap-required security flags (`apparmor=unconfined`, `seccomp=unconfined`, `systempaths=unconfined`, `cap_add: SYS_ADMIN`). These relax the outer container so the runtime's nested userns sandboxes can come up. Removing any one of them breaks sandbox provisioning.

> **Image requirement: burrow-cli ≥ 0.3.12.** Warren is co-tenanted with [burrow](https://github.com/jayminwest/burrow) inside the container and talks to it over a shared unix socket. The published image pins `@os-eco/burrow-cli@0.3.12` (see [`Dockerfile`](Dockerfile)); if you build your own image or override the runtime, install burrow-cli **0.3.12 or newer** — earlier releases predate the runtime contract warren depends on (agent spawn shape, resume support, event kinds) and will fail at dispatch.

## Deploy to Fly.io

Same image, same volume layout, same security flags:

```bash
fly launch                                    # uses ./fly.toml
fly volumes create warren_data --size 50 --region sjc
fly secrets set \
    WARREN_API_TOKEN=... \
    BURROW_API_TOKEN=... \
    WARREN_BURROW_TOKEN=... \
    ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=... \
    GITHUB_TOKEN=...
# Optional: attach a managed Postgres instead of the on-volume SQLite.
# Without this, warren falls back to sqlite:///data/warren.db.
#   fly secrets set WARREN_DB_URL=postgres://user:pw@host/db
fly deploy
```

### Continuous deployment from GitHub Actions

Once warren is live on Fly, wiring tag-driven auto-deploy is two commands:

```bash
fly tokens create deploy -a <your-warren-app> --name "github-actions" --expiry 8760h \
  | gh secret set FLY_API_TOKEN -R <your-org>/<your-fork>
```

Then add a `deploy` job to your release workflow that runs after release/tag:

```yaml
deploy:
  needs: release
  if: needs.release.outputs.release == 'true'
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  concurrency:
    group: fly-deploy-<your-warren-app>
    cancel-in-progress: false
  steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v6
    - uses: superfly/flyctl-actions/setup-flyctl@master
    - env: { FLY_API_TOKEN: "${{ secrets.FLY_API_TOKEN }}" }
      run: flyctl deploy --remote-only --app <your-warren-app>
```

The deploy-scoped token is bound to a single app and cannot list secrets, ssh, or touch other apps, so it's safe to live in CI. See `.github/workflows/release.yml` for the reference shape used by `warren-deployed.fly.dev`.

### Observability on a live deploy

Warren ships enough operator-visible surface for a single-box / single-Fly-app deploy to be inspectable without bolting on extra infrastructure. The pieces:

- **Health & readiness probes.** `GET /healthz` is a cheap liveness check (returns `{ok: true}`, auth-exempt — point Fly's `[[services.http_checks]]` or any uptime monitor at it). `GET /readyz` runs deeper diagnostics (DB reachable, bwrap usable, canopy clone fresh when `CANOPY_REPO_URL` is set) and returns a `DiagnosticCheck[]` payload — use it for deploy gating, not for hot-path liveness. `GET /version` returns `{version}` straight from `src/index.ts` so you can confirm a rollout actually swapped the image.
- **Structured JSON logs.** The server emits one [pino](https://getpino.io) JSON line per event on stdout (name `warren`, level controlled by `WARREN_LOG_LEVEL`, default `info`). On Fly that means everything is queryable with `fly logs -a <your-warren-app>` and via the **Logs** tab on the Fly dashboard (`https://fly.io/apps/<your-warren-app>/monitoring`). Pipe through `| jq` locally for ad-hoc filtering; ship to an external store with a [pino transport](https://getpino.io/#/docs/transports) if you need retention beyond Fly's window.
- **Correlation IDs.** Every HTTP response carries an `X-Request-ID` header (`src/server/request-id.ts`, warren-30af). Warren honours a well-formed inbound `X-Request-ID` and otherwise mints one; the same id is bound into the per-request pino child logger, so grepping `fly logs | jq 'select(.req_id == "…")'` reconstructs the full server-side trace for one client call. Forward the header from any reverse proxy in front of warren to keep the chain unbroken.
- **Per-run cost & token usage.** `runs.cost_usd` and `runs.tokens_*` columns are populated for the `pi` and `claude-code` built-ins (SPEC §11.K); the UI run-detail page surfaces them and `GET /analytics/cost?from=&to=&projectId=` aggregates across runs (`src/db/repos/runs.ts:listForAnalytics`). This is reporting, not enforcement — budget caps are deferred to R-17.
- **Fly dashboards.** The **Metrics** tab on the Fly app dashboard graphs CPU, RAM, and per-volume IO out of the box; pair it with the **Logs** tab above for incident triage. `fly status -a <your-warren-app>` and `fly vm status` print machine + volume state from the CLI. `fly ssh console -a <your-warren-app>` drops you into the running container if you need to inspect `/data/warren.db` directly (sqlite default) or tail the canopy clone under `WARREN_CANOPY_DIR`.
- **Pre-flight checks.** Run `warren doctor` (`src/cli/commands/doctor.ts`) against a deployed instance to surface common misconfigurations — empty/placeholder bearer tokens, unbalanced preview markers, missing `WARREN_PREVIEW_HOST` when previews are wired, etc. Cheaper than reading the logs after a failed run.

There is no built-in Prometheus / OpenTelemetry exporter in V1. If you need one, the request-id + pino combination is the seam to extend; the route table (`ROUTE_TABLE` in `src/server/handlers.ts`, documented in [`docs/http-api.md`](docs/http-api.md)) is the stable surface to instrument against.

## Power features (opt-in)

Warren bundles a small set of [os-eco](https://github.com/jayminwest/os-eco) tools as built-in features. They're not required for a basic run. Each lights up when you use it and stays silent when you don't.

### Custom agents: bring your own prompt library

The built-in `claude-code`, `sapling`, and `pi` agents cover the common case. To define custom agents as versioned prompts (with inheritance, mixins, and per-agent sandbox config), point warren at a [canopy](https://github.com/jayminwest/canopy) repo:

```bash
fly secrets set CANOPY_REPO_URL=https://github.com/<you>/agents.git
```

Library agents override built-ins by name. See [SPEC §4.2](SPEC.md#42-the-bundle-expressed-in-canopy) for the agent-as-prompt schema.

### Agent memory: persistent expertise across runs

If a project has a `.mulch/` directory, every run gets that expertise primed into context on spawn. As the agent learns conventions, patterns, and failure modes, it records them with `ml record`; reap merges the new records back to the project's persistent `.mulch/` with last-write-wins by timestamp. Memory accumulates across runs without a database, just files in the repo. See [mulch](https://github.com/jayminwest/mulch).

### Issue queue: agents work from and write to seeds

If a project has a `.seeds/` directory, agents can `sd ready` for unblocked work, claim it with `sd update`, file follow-ups with `sd create`, and close completed seeds with `sd close`. Reap closes any seeds the agent marked done. The trigger scheduler can also fire on past-due `extensions.scheduledFor` seed timestamps ([SPEC §11.I](SPEC.md)). See [seeds](https://github.com/jayminwest/seeds).

`.seeds/` also enables **plan-run dispatch**: `POST /plan-runs { project, planId, agent }` against a seeds plan walks its children sequentially, one warren run per child, gating each step on the previous PR merging before the next dispatches. Children whose seeds are already closed are skipped, so re-dispatching the same plan after partial completion resumes from the next open child. PlanRun is a dispatch mode on top of the existing single-run primitive — same spawn path, same sandbox, same event stream. Tune the coordinator with `WARREN_PLAN_RUN_TICK_MS` (default 10s) or disable it with `WARREN_PLAN_RUN_DISABLED=1`. See [SPEC §11.P](SPEC.md#11p-planrun-serial-plan-execution-pl-a258-2026-05-18).

### Steerable harness: sapling as an alternative to claude-code

The built-in `sapling` agent is a headless coding harness with proactive context management. Use it the same way you'd use `claude-code`. See [sapling](https://github.com/jayminwest/sapling).

### Shared coordination: plot as a peer-network substrate

If a project has a `.plot/` directory, runs dispatched with a `plot_id` get `PLOT_ID` + `PLOT_ACTOR=agent:<name>:<run-id>` injected into the sandbox. The agent inside reads context with `plot get` and appends `decision_made` / `question_posed` / `artifact_produced` events with `plot append`. Warren appends a `run_dispatched` event to the originating Plot on spawn and merges the workspace `.plot/` back at reap, mirroring agent events into the run's event stream tagged with `plot_id`. Projects without `.plot/` are byte-identical to the pre-change behavior. See [plot](https://github.com/jayminwest/plot) and [SPEC §11.O](SPEC.md#11o-plot-integration-pl-2047-2026-05-17).

When a project ships **both** `.plot/` and `.seeds/`, plan-runs compose onto Plot. A `POST /plan-runs { plot_id }` emits one `plan_run_dispatched` event on the bound Plot at start, threads `plot_id` through every child so each gets `PLOT_ID` + `PLOT_ACTOR` in its sandbox and emits its own `run_dispatched` event, and auto-transitions the Plot from `active` → `done` when the final child merges. Plan-runs dispatched without `plot_id`, or against a project without `.plot/`, are byte-identical to the standalone plan-run baseline. See [SPEC §11.P.Plot](SPEC.md#11pplot-planrun--plot-composition-pl-7937-2026-05-18).

### PR-body template: per-project overrides for the PR warren opens

After a successful run, warren opens a PR with a generated body (summary, run link, commits, files-changed, prompt, etc.). Projects override individual sections by shipping a `.warren/pr-template.md` file: every `## <fragment_name>` heading replaces the default body for that fragment. Unspecified fragments keep the built-in defaults, so you can override just one piece.

```markdown
## trailer

Reviewed-by: @platform-team

Please follow our [PR checklist](https://example.com/checklist) before merging.
```

Recognized fragment names: `title`, `summary`, `run`, `seeds`, `preview_url_or_placeholder`, `commits`, `files_changed`, `prompt`, `trailer`. A whitespace-only body removes the fragment entirely. Unknown names + unbalanced preview markers surface via `warren doctor` so typos are loud. See [SPEC §11.L](SPEC.md) for the full fragment contract.

### Per-run preview environments: click the agent's branch instead of checking it out

When a project ships a `.warren/preview.yaml`, warren launches `preview.command` as a sidecar inside the same burrow workspace after a successful run, allocates a port, and exposes the running app at `https://run-<runId>.<WARREN_PREVIEW_HOST>`. Reviewers click the URL instead of `git checkout`-ing the branch. Idle sessions are reaped automatically; the run-detail page surfaces a status badge and a manual teardown button. Opt in with two pieces:

1. **Operator side.** Set `WARREN_PREVIEW_HOST=preview.<your-host>` and point a wildcard CNAME at the warren box (see [Per-run previews: operator setup](#per-run-previews-operator-setup) below). Without `WARREN_PREVIEW_HOST` the launch sub-step is a no-op (the run still completes, the URL just has no listener).
2. **Project side.** Ship `.warren/preview.yaml` with the preview block at the top level:

   ```yaml
   type: server
   command: bun run dev
   port: 3000
   readiness_path: /healthz
   idle_ttl: 30m
   max_lifetime: 8h
   ```

   Projects that don't opt in skip the preview sub-step entirely. See [SPEC §11.L](SPEC.md#11l-per-run-preview-environments-2026-05-14) for the full contract.

## Per-run previews: operator setup

Enable the preview proxy by giving warren a host suffix it can route on:

```bash
WARREN_PREVIEW_HOST=preview.warren.example.com
```

Warren then matches `Host: run-<runId>.preview.warren.example.com` as a preamble before its API/UI routes and forwards to the in-sandbox port allocated at reap time. The login route (`GET /runs/:id/preview/login?token=…&redirect=…`) accepts the warren bearer in the query and issues a domain-scoped signed cookie (`warren_preview`); the proxy rejects unauthenticated browser requests with 401 (not 502). The HMAC key is derived from `WARREN_API_TOKEN`, so there's no second secret to manage. `warren doctor` warns if the token is empty or matches a placeholder.

**Wildcard DNS.** Point a wildcard CNAME at the warren box so every `run-*` subdomain resolves:

```
*.preview.warren.example.com   CNAME   warren.example.com
```

**TLS via Caddy with a wildcard cert.** TLS stays on the operator's edge (SPEC §8.1 / §11.D). Use Caddy's DNS-01 challenge to issue `*.preview.warren.example.com` (HTTP-01 cannot issue wildcards). Minimal Caddyfile snippet:

```caddyfile
*.preview.warren.example.com {
    tls {
        dns cloudflare {env.CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN}
    }
    reverse_proxy localhost:8080
}
```

Caddy's DNS-01 plugin supports Cloudflare, Route 53, DigitalOcean, Hetzner, Linode, OVH, Vultr, and others. See [caddy-dns](https://github.com/caddy-dns) for the current list. If your provider isn't on it, an operator-controlled per-project subdomain pattern is the alternative.

**Lifecycle knobs.** Tune for scale via `WARREN_PREVIEW_IDLE_TTL` (default `30m`), `WARREN_PREVIEW_MAX_LIFETIME` (`8h`), `WARREN_PREVIEW_MAX_LIVE` (`20`), `WARREN_PREVIEW_PORT_RANGE` (`30000-31000`), and `WARREN_PREVIEW_EVICTION_TICK_MS` (`60000`). Per-project overrides for `idle_ttl` and `max_lifetime` live in `.warren/preview.yaml`. `/readyz` surfaces port-allocator saturation warnings.

Cross-host routing for runs landing on remote workers is in progress as R-12. Until then, the proxy returns **501** for off-host runs.

See [SPEC §11.L](SPEC.md#11l-per-run-preview-environments-2026-05-14) for the full design.

## Architecture

```
┌──────────────── container (bwrap-friendly host) ────────────────┐

                          [browser]
```

Under the hood, warren talks to [burrow](https://github.com/jayminwest/burrow) as the sandbox runtime. They are co-tenanted inside the container, share a unix socket, and share a bearer token (`BURROW_API_TOKEN` == `WARREN_BURROW_TOKEN`). See [SPEC §10.3](SPEC.md#103-container-layout) for the full layout.

## CLI

The `warren` (or `wr`) admin CLI is for ops; the web UI is daily.

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `warren register-agent <name>` | Refresh canopy + register one agent |
| `warren add-project <git-url>` | Clone a project under `/data/projects` |
| `warren run <agent> <project> -p "..."` | One-shot run, no UI |
| `warren plan run <plan-id> --project <id> --agent <name>` | Dispatch a serial plan-run, tail events as NDJSON |
| `warren plan cancel <plan-run-id>` | Cancel a plan-run and its in-flight child |
| `warren plan status <plan-run-id>` | Child-state table with per-child cost + duration |
| `warren plan list [--project --state]` | List plan-runs, optionally filtered |
| `warren init` | Scaffold a `.warren/` directory in a project |
| `warren doctor` | Runtime reachable? Bwrap working? DB reachable? |
| `warren serve` | Start the HTTP server (default in entrypoint) |
| `warren db migrate-to-postgres --from <sqlite> --to <pg-url>` | One-shot SQLite → Postgres porter ([R-13](ROADMAP.md)) |

`warren run claude-code <project> -p "..."` does the full composition end-to-end: resolves the agent (built-in or library), provisions the sandbox, dispatches the run, streams events back, then pushes the branch. If the project has `.mulch/` or `.seeds/`, those round-trip too.

## HTTP API

```

GET    /runs/:id/preview/login       issue signed-cookie + 302 (auth-exempt, ?token=)
POST   /runs/:id/preview/teardown    manual preview teardown (idempotent)

POST   /plan-runs                    { project, planId, agent } → serial dispatch (.seeds/ only)
GET    /plan-runs                    list (filter by project / state)
GET    /plan-runs/:id                detail + fanned-out child runs[]
POST   /plan-runs/:id/cancel         cancel; aborts the in-flight child run
GET    /plan-runs/:id/events         NDJSON tail union over every child run

GET    /healthz                      liveness (no auth)
GET    /readyz                       runtime + first-render check
```

`Authorization: Bearer ${WARREN_API_TOKEN}` is required on every non-`/healthz` route. Warren does not terminate TLS; front it with Caddy on a home server, or rely on Fly's edge.

## Development

Requires [Bun](https://bun.sh) v1.1+.

```bash
bun install
bun test                                          # all unit tests
bun run lint                                      # biome check --error-on-warnings
bun run typecheck                                 # tsc --noEmit
bun test && bun run lint && bun run typecheck     # all quality gates
```

UI development (separate from the server build):

```bash
bun run ui:install
bun run ui:dev
```

## Client SDK

`src/client/` exports a typed TypeScript client for driving warren programmatically — dispatching runs, streaming events, managing projects and plots — without reimplementing the wire format. Zero server-side imports; intended for scripts, CLIs, acceptance harnesses, and external agents.

### Setup

```bash
export WARREN_BASE_URL=https://warren.example.com   # default: http://localhost:8080
export WARREN_API_TOKEN=<your-token>
```

### Dispatch a run and wait for it

```ts
import { WarrenClient } from "./src/client/index.ts";

const warren = WarrenClient.fromEnv();
await warren.probe();  // throws WarrenUnreachableError if warren is down

const { run } = await warren.dispatch({
  agent: "claude-code",
  project: "my-project",
  prompt: "Add input validation to the signup form",
  branch: "main",          // optional: git ref to clone from
  model: "claude-sonnet-4-6", // optional: override the default model
});

const final = await warren.waitForRun(run.id, {
  onTick: (r) => console.log(`${r.id}: ${r.state}`),
});
console.log(`Run ${final.state}, PR: ${final.prUrl}`);
```

### Stream events

```ts
for await (const event of warren.streamRunEvents(run.id, { follow: true })) {
  if (event.stream === "stdout") process.stdout.write(String(event.payload));
}
```

### Steer a running agent

```ts
await warren.steer(run.id, {
  body: "Focus on the email field first, skip phone for now",
  priority: "high",
});
```

### Plots and plan-runs

```ts
// List active plots
const { plots } = await warren.listPlots({ status: "active" });

// Get full plot detail (intent + attachments + event log)
const plot = await warren.getPlot(plots[0].id);

// Dispatch a serial plan-run against a seeds plan
const { planRun, children } = await warren.createPlanRun({
  project: "my-project",
  planId: "pl-abc123",
  agent: "claude-code",
  plotId: plot.id,  // optional: compose onto the plot
});

// Inspect a plan-run's child-state + fanned-out child runs[]
const detail = await warren.getPlanRun(planRun.id);
for (const child of detail.children) {
  const run = detail.runs.find((r) => r.id === child.runId);
  console.log(`#${child.seq} ${child.seedId} [${child.state}] cost=${run?.costUsd ?? "—"}`);
}

// List plan-runs, optionally filtered by project / state
const { planRuns } = await warren.listPlanRuns({ project: "my-project", state: "running" });
```

### Error handling

```ts
import { WarrenClientError, WarrenUnreachableError } from "./src/client/index.ts";

try {
  await warren.dispatch({ agent: "claude-code", project: "bad-id", prompt: "..." });
} catch (err) {
  if (err instanceof WarrenUnreachableError) {
    // warren is down or unreachable
  } else if (err instanceof WarrenClientError) {
    // warren returned an error: err.status, err.code, err.message, err.hint
  }
}
```

The full type surface (all inputs, outputs, row shapes, enums) is in `src/client/types.ts`.

## Operating model

How the current release is scoped. Full details in [SPEC §11.D](SPEC.md#11d-v1-security-posture-known-limitations):

- **Single bearer token.** Rotation, expiry, and scopes are not supported; rotate by editing `.env` (or `fly secrets set`) and bouncing the container. Per-user identity is on the roadmap (R-09).
- **TLS is upstream's job.** Direct HTTP on a non-loopback bind is a misconfiguration; `warren doctor` warns.
- **Trust-the-socket** between warren and the runtime inside the container, which are co-tenanted by design.
- **No CSRF, single-user.** UI calls warren's API with the bearer; CORS is strict.
- **SQLite by default; Postgres optional.** Run history and scheduler state live in `/data/warren.db` on the local volume out of the box. Org-scale deploys can attach a managed Postgres by setting `WARREN_DB_URL=postgres://user:pw@host/db`; burrow's per-run SQLite stays untouched either way.
- **One host is the concurrency ceiling.** Horizontal scale-out across machines is in flight as R-12.

## Roadmap

The active direction is org-readiness, extending warren from "one team, one box" to "50-engineer org, their own infra":

- **Remote sandbox workers** ([R-12](ROADMAP.md)): one warren dispatching across many runtime workers; lifts the single-host ceiling.
- **SSO / per-user identity** ([R-09](ROADMAP.md)): OIDC login replacing the shared bearer. The bearer stays as a service-account path for CI.
- **MCP support** ([R-15](ROADMAP.md)): agents declare `mcp_servers` in their prompt frontmatter; warren plumbs credentials into the sandbox.
- **Cross-project activity UI + stable OpenAPI** ([R-14](ROADMAP.md)): a "what is every agent doing right now" view, plus a versioned API contract.
- **Audit log** ([R-16](ROADMAP.md)) and **cost / concurrency guardrails** ([R-17](ROADMAP.md)): security review and budget control once real user identity lands.
- **GitHub App auth** ([R-18](ROADMAP.md)): installation-scoped, short-lived per-run tokens replacing the shared PAT.

All items are additive: none change current behavior when unconfigured. See [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) for design sketches and sequencing.
