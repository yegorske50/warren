/**
 * Canonical wire vocabulary (warren-b229 / pl-b82d step 26).
 *
 * THIS FILE IS THE SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH for every enum-shaped value that
 * crosses warren's HTTP wire (lifecycle states, failure-cause discriminators,
 * run mode, clone kind, event stream, inbox classes, salvage triggers, and
 * the HTTP response envelopes — warren-42f1). Every other layer — the
 * drizzle column metadata (`src/db/schema/columns.ts`), the SDK
 * (`src/client/types*.ts`), and the browser UI (`src/ui/src/api/types.ts`) —
 * RE-EXPORTS these names. None of them may redeclare one.
 * `bun run check:wire-types` (warren-d371) enforces that mechanically.
 *
 * Why `src/core/` and why this direction:
 *
 *   - `src/core/` is warren's dependency-free kernel (errors + ids). It
 *     imports nothing, so every layer — including the Vite-bundled UI, which
 *     must never reach `src/db/schema/` — can import it without inheriting a
 *     dependency.
 *   - The three surfaces drifted for as long as they were hand-kept copies
 *     (`RunFailureReason` lost values in the SDK and the UI;
 *     `RefreshAgentsResponse.removed` read as `{name}[]` against a server
 *     truth of `string[]`).
 *
 * Container-shape convention: every set is a frozen `as const` tuple
 * narrowed by `satisfies readonly <Union>[]`, so the tuple and the union it
 * derives can never disagree. Membership is tested with the exported type
 * guards, never by rebuilding a `Set` at a call site.
 *
 * The physical-schema constants (table names, index names, row-id helpers)
 * are NOT wire vocabulary and stay in `src/db/schema/columns.ts`.

/**
 * Failure-cause discriminator for a `failed` run (warren-3c40, warren-5165).
 * `state:failed` alone can't tell several different failure shapes apart.
 * Reap infers from the warren state on entry plus event content:
 *
 *   - still `queued` on entry ⇒ no events ever flowed from burrow ⇒
 *     `never_started` (config/runtime issue, e.g. under-specified prompt).
 *   - `running` on entry but events table holds no model-turn output
 *     (`text` / `thinking` / `tool_use` on stdout) ⇒ `no_model_response`
 *     (typically a credential/auth failure — the warren-5165 symptom was
 *     claude-code exiting with "Not logged in" before any assistant turn;
 *     also covers rate-limit and provider-network failures).
 *   - `running` on entry with model output ⇒ `crashed` (agent ran and
 *     hit an unrecoverable error mid-conversation).
 *   - `timed_out` (warren-285d) is set by the heartbeat watchdog
 *     (src/runs/watchdog.ts) when a `running` run goes silent-but-busy past
 *     `WARREN_RUN_HEARTBEAT_TIMEOUT_MS` — e.g. a runaway gate command behind
 *     a stuck bash tool. The watchdog cancels the burrow run and reaps it
 *     `failed` so the sandbox tree is torn down instead of pinning CPU
 *     forever; burrow reports no timeout state, so warren owns the deadline.
 *   - `sandbox_run_lost` (warren-b1a9; renamed from `burrow_run_lost` in
 *     warren-d15c for the runtime-neutral warren-36cb taxonomy) means the
 *     runtime backend has no record of the run — a burrow 404 (local) or a
 *     pod vanished from the API with no cancel intent (K8s). A pod warren
 *     deleted itself is NOT lost: cancel intent wins → `cancelled` (warren-fe9b).
 *   - `sandbox_unreachable` (warren-af76) means burrow stayed up but
 *     unresponsive — the socket probe timed out, so the bridge errored
 *     with `sandboxRunMissing:false` and reconnected with no forward
 *     progress past `BRIDGE_STALL_CEILING` consecutive attempts. The
 *     reconnect loop gives up and finalizes the warren row `failed` with
 *     this reason instead of spinning forever (the run otherwise wedges
 *     in `running`). Distinct from `sandbox_run_lost`, which is a clean
 *     404; here burrow never answered at all.
 *   - `dropped_commit` (warren-72b9) means reap's `git push` landed zero
 *     commits ahead of the base (`reap.empty_push`) AND the workspace was
 *     still dirty with non-bookkeeping paths — agent edited/staged work
 *     but never `git commit`ed. A clean tree, or dirt only under warren
 *     bookkeeping (`.mulch/`, `.seeds/`; warren-89b0), is a deliberate
 *     no-op: fresh-branch dispatches stay `succeeded` with `noChanges` on
 *     `reap.empty_push` / `reap.completed`; ref-dispatch (`ref` /
 *     `targetBranch`) reaps `failed`/`no_changes` instead (warren-ba08).
 *   - `no_changes` (warren-ba08): ref-dispatch zero-commit over a clean or
 *     bookkeeping-only tree — repair produced no new work. Distinct from
 *     `dropped_commit` (dirty non-bookkeeping tree). Fresh-branch no-ops
 *     keep the warren-89b0 succeeded+`noChanges`-flag shape.
 *   - `finalize_failed` (warren-495d) means reap's finalize did NOT
 *     complete its branch push before it timed out or failed — under K8s
 *     the in-pod finalize round-trip (git push → mirror deltas → POST the
 *     result) can time out (`WARREN_K8S_FINALIZE_TIMEOUT_MS`, default
 *     120s) or the pod can vanish / reach a terminal phase before it
 *     posts a result, yielding a structured FAILED `FinalizeResult` with
 *     `pushed:false`. Marking the run `failed` (instead of letting it
 *     masquerade as `succeeded`) keeps a run whose commits never reached
 *     origin from reporting success — and pairs with reap PRESERVING the
 *     workspace (skipping `terminate`) so the agent's commits stay
 *     recoverable instead of being silently destroyed. Distinct from
 *     `dropped_commit` (push succeeded but landed zero commits over a
 *     still-dirty tree): here the push itself never completed.
 *   - `push_rejected_policy` (warren-b68d) narrows `finalize_failed` to a push
 *     the REMOTE refused on policy grounds; see `../runtime/push-rejection.ts`.
 *   - `finalize_unposted` (warren-5ea1) means the K8s in-pod finalize
 *     never POSTed a result at all — the pod reached a terminal phase (or
 *     vanished, or the round-trip timed out) while warren was still waiting,
 *     so reap's `FinalizeResult` is the provider's synthesized degradation,
 *     not a pod-computed collection. The canonical trigger: the agent exited
 *     WITHOUT its terminal envelope reaching warren, so no reap intent was
 *     ever parked while the pod was alive to serve it. Distinct from
 *     `finalize_failed` (the pod DID post a result whose branch-push stage
 *     failed): here the workspace died with the pod, so the only recovery path
 *     is the salvage bundle/rescue ref the pod POSTed before exiting.
 *   - `provider_error` (warren-edc3) means the agent's terminal model turn
 *     ended with `stopReason === "error"` and a non-empty provider
 *     `errorMessage` (e.g. Anthropic `400` "Your credit balance is too low to
 *     access the Anthropic API"). Burrow sees the agent process exit 0 and
 *     marks the run `succeeded`, so the in-stream terminal detect (warren-e281
 *     / pl-5516, which keys off the `agent_end` envelope) misses it when the
 *     error signal rides the per-turn `turn_end` envelope instead. Reap's
 *     safety net scans the event log for the terminal error turn and flips an
 *     otherwise-`succeeded` run to `failed`, blocking the bookkeeping-only PR /
 *     seed close / plan-run advance. The message surfaces on the
 *     `reap.provider_error` event; `failure_reason` carries only the
 *     discriminator (the column is enum-narrowed, not free text).
 *   - `oom_killed` (warren-9cce) means the agent container was cgroup
 *     OOM-killed — burrow's `oomKilled()` probe or the K8s
 *     `terminated.reason=="OOMKilled"` signal, carried through the run-state
 *     probe's `terminalReason` onto the finalized row.
 *   - `agent_died` (warren-7f0b) means the in-pod agent-entrypoint's idle
 *     watchdog killed the harness — the `stdin_hold_timeout` system witness —
 *     while the pod (and its finalize poller) may still be live, the zombie
 *     shape the watchdog-reconcile net reaps so the in-pod salvage fires
 *     before the emptyDir disappears. Distinct from `crashed`/`timed_out`.
 *   - `sandbox_failed` (warren-daef) means the sandbox PRIMITIVE itself
 *     broke before the agent ever ran — bwrap could not create the
 *     namespace (user namespaces disabled, missing setuid bit, AppArmor
 *     policy) or sandbox-exec refused the profile, so the run died with
 *     the sandbox's own error on stderr and zero model turns. Reap
 *     infers it from a bwrap/sandbox-exec error line on `stream=stderr`
 *     when no model-turn output exists, so a broken host stops masquerading as
 *     `no_model_response` (which reads as a credential/provider fault and sends
 *     the operator down the wrong debugging path). Distinct from
 *     `no_model_response` (the agent started but produced nothing) and `never_started` (the bridge
 *     never claimed the row).
 *   - `spawn_failed` (warren-4e2a, warren-950d): the agent PROCESS was never exec'd — a missing
 *     docker CLI, or the K8s uid-drop preflight refusal; reap skips the seeds commit + push.
 *   - `evicted` (warren-c0cd) means the kubelet evicted the run pod under node
 *     resource pressure (K8s `status.reason=="Evicted"`) — most often
 *     ephemeral-storage exhaustion (the emptyDir workspace outgrowing its
 *     budget). K8s-only; distinct from `oom_killed` (a container cgroup kill)
 *     and `crashed` (an agent fault) because an eviction is an infra-capacity
 *     signal, surfaced via the run-state probe's `terminalReason`.
 *   - `preempted` (warren-ea4b): the pod's GKE Spot node was reclaimed
 *     (K8s-only, retryable — the substrate lost the run, not the agent).
 *
 * Null on succeeded/cancelled rows.

/**
 * Forge-seam error taxonomy (warren-0993 / docs/design/forge-contract.md
 * §2). The ONE taxonomy the domain switches on across the forge seam — it
 * replaces the three drifted failure conventions the GitHub surface had
 * (`OpenPullRequestResult`, `CheckPrMergedResult`,
 * `FetchCheckRunsResult`; §6.4). Seam methods return `ForgeResult<T>` and
 * never throw; every arm below has a live call site:
 *
 *   - `no_credential`  — nothing is configured at all: no token env, no
 *     App credentials. Detection site is the provider constructor or the
 *     credential mint, BEFORE any HTTP happens. Distinct from
 *     `unauthorized` (a credential existed and was rejected): here the
 *     domain skips the step rather than reporting an auth failure.
 *   - `unauthorized`   — HTTP 401: an expired or wrong credential.
 *     Detected by the transport error classifier off the response status.
 *     Under App mode this is the hourly-installation-token-expiry signal
 *     and triggers a re-mint; distinct from `forbidden` (403 — the
 *     credential authenticated but lacks the grant).
 *   - `forbidden`      — HTTP 403 that is NOT a rate limit. Detected by
 *     the classifier once the `x-ratelimit-remaining: 0` /
 *     `Retry-After` rate-limit shape has been ruled out. Distinct from
 *     `unauthorized` (the credential itself was refused) and from
 *     `rate_limited` (same status, different semantics and a retryAfter
 *     hint).
 *   - `not_found`      — HTTP 404/410. Detected by the classifier off the
 *     status. Fatal for a merge gate (`merge-gate.ts`): a vanished PR
 *     means `closed_unmerged`-class handling, never a keep-waiting retry.
 *   - `conflict`       — HTTP 409/422 the provider could not resolve.
 *     Detected after the provider's own duplicate-resolution dance
 *     (`openPullRequest` is idempotent by contract — GitHub's
 *     422-then-search stays INSIDE the provider), so this arm means a
 *     genuine unresolvable conflict, e.g. a head-branch state GitHub
 *     refuses.
 *   - `rate_limited`   — HTTP 403/429 WITH rate-limit semantics
 *     (`x-ratelimit-remaining: 0` or a `Retry-After` header). Detected by
 *     the transport classifier; `ForgeError.retryAfterMs` carries the
 *     hint when the forge knows it. Transport retry absorbs it inside the
 *     provider (§3: semantic retry stays in the domain, transport retry
 *     moves to the forge). Distinct from bare `forbidden`.
 *   - `push_protected` — GitHub secret-scanning push protection rejected
 *     the push. Detected at the git-push boundary from the push output;
 *     `detail` carries the unblock URL GitHub returns so an operator can
 *     allow-list the secret. Distinct from `forbidden`, which is an HTTP
 *     API grant failure, not a push-time scan verdict.
 *   - `unsupported`    — this forge/credential mode cannot do the
 *     operation at all (§5 capability degradation: e.g. a fine-grained
 *     PAT calling `listChecks` when `capabilities.checkRuns` is false).
 *     Detected BEFORE transport by reading the provider's declared
 *     `ForgeCapabilities` — no HTTP is ever attempted. Distinct from
 *     `forbidden`, which is discovered at transport time.
 *   - `network`        — no HTTP response at all: DNS failure, refused
 *     connection, TLS error, fetch abort. Detected at the fetch boundary
 *     (a thrown transport error rather than a response). Distinct from
 *     every status-carrying arm — there is no `status` to log.
 *   - `http_error`     — everything else with a response: any status the
 *     classifier did not map onto a narrower arm (5xx, unexpected 4xx
 *     shapes). The catch-all; `status` carries the transport status for
