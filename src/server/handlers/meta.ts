 * `GET /whoami` — the caller's own identity and capability set
 * (warren-e195).
 *
 * The server-side source of truth for the UI capability layer: the SPA
 * calls this once on mount and renders operator-only affordances from the
 * answer instead of inferring permission from "is there a token in
 * localStorage". Everything it reports is derived from the request the
 * caller already made, so it discloses nothing the caller didn't supply.
 *
 * Its policy is `readPublic`, not `anonymous` — deliberately. An
 * `anonymous` route is auth-exempt, so the gate never runs and
 * `RouteContext.actor` is undefined: the route could not name its caller
 * at all. `readPublic` gives the UI what it needs in both modes. Under
 * `WARREN_AUTH=public` a credential-less caller is admitted as
 * `ANONYMOUS_ACTOR` and learns it is anonymous; under the default
 * `WARREN_AUTH=token` it gets the same 401 as every other API route,
 * which the SPA already routes to the login screen.
 *
 * The body varies with the `Authorization` header, so it is per-caller and
 * must not be shared-cached; `Vary` says so to any proxy in front of
 * warren. The UI is expected to hold it in memory for the session.

/**
 * `GET /preview/config` (R-19 / docs/design/preview-environments.md path addendum, warren-016d).
 *
 * Surfaces the deployment-wide preview routing mode + optional host so the
 * UI's `PreviewCard` can render the canonical preview URL without having
 * to encode mode-specific shapes itself. The login handshake at
 * `/runs/:id/preview/login` does its own server-side redirect resolution,
 * so this endpoint is purely informational — the UI calls it once and
 * caches indefinitely (mode/host change requires a warren restart).
 *
 * `host` is null when path mode is configured without `WARREN_PREVIEW_HOST`;
 * in that case the UI derives the URL from `window.location.origin`. In
 * subdomain mode `host` is always set (boot rejects subdomain-without-host).
 *
 * `port` (warren-3f8a) is the dedicated path-mode preview listener's
 * public port — path-mode previews live on their own origin (same
 * hostname, this port) so agent-authored preview code cannot read the
 * operator token out of the UI origin's storage. Null in subdomain mode
 * and on the unix transport's legacy same-origin mounting; the UI then
 * keeps the portless URL shape.
