 * `dispatcherHandle` (who dispatched), the provider/model overrides, and
 * `failureReason` — a raw internal error string built as
 * `dispatch_failed:${formatError(err)}` that can carry host paths
 * (`src/plan-runs/coordinator.ts`). That is the warren-4385 disclosure
 * class arriving through an unprojected wire field rather than an error
 * envelope.
 *
 * Same rules as every other projection (`src/server/projection.ts`):
 * allowlist never denylist, one construction site, two audiences. A
 * column added to either table tomorrow is absent from the public body
 * until someone classifies it here.
