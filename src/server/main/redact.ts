/**
 * Central pino redaction config for warren's loggers (warren-b2dd /
 * pl-f700 step 6).
 *
 * Defense-in-depth: structured log objects should never carry a raw
 * GitHub token, bearer credential, or other secret-shaped value even
 * when a caller accidentally logs a whole config/headers object. pino's
 * `redact` option walks each log object and censors any value at the
 * listed paths before serialization, so the secret never reaches the
 * transport.
 *
 * The path list targets the field *names* warren actually threads
 * through its structured logs — both the literal env-var names
 * (`GITHUB_TOKEN`, `BURROW_API_TOKEN`, …) and the camelCase fields on
 * the typed config objects (`githubToken`, `token`, …), at the top
 * level and one level of nesting (`*.token`). pino redact paths are not
 * deep-recursive by default, so we enumerate the wildcard explicitly.
 *
 * This is a backstop, not a license to log secrets — call sites should
 * still redact at the source (e.g. `redactDbUrl`). The censor string is
 * the pino default `[Redacted]`.
