/**
 * In-memory idempotency window for `POST /runs` (warren-d525).
 *
 * A duplicate delivery of a single logical dispatch — a proxy/LB replay,
 * a scheduler double-fire, or a client that re-retries a timed-out POST —
 * must NOT spawn a second run (a fresh burrow + agent silently ~2x'ing
 * agent spend). The dispatch handler keys each request on its
 * `Idempotency-Key` header scoped to the target project and routes the
 * spawn through this store: the first request for a `(projectId, key)`
 * pair runs the real dispatch and caches its 201 body; any duplicate
 * within the TTL window replays that cached body instead of spawning.
 *
 * The store also folds CONCURRENT duplicates: the cached value is the
 * in-flight dispatch promise itself, so a second request that lands
 * before the first resolves awaits the same spawn rather than racing it.
 * A failed dispatch evicts the entry so the next retry can re-spawn.
 *
 * In-memory is sufficient: the window only needs to cover retries/replays
 * (minutes), warren is single-process per deployment, and a process
 * restart legitimately reopens the window (a post-restart retry hitting a
 * run the previous process already spawned is a far rarer event than the
 * client/proxy retries this guards). Durable cross-restart dedupe is out
 * of scope for V1.
