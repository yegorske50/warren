 * Distinct from `src/warren-config/` (which loads per-PROJECT `.warren/`
 * directories from each cloned repo) and from `src/server/config.ts`
 * (which reads the warren server's own env vars). This module owns the
 * operator-facing config FILE that lives next to the warren deployment
 * — `warren.toml` — where blocks like `[workers]` (added by step 8 /
 * warren-272c) declare cluster-shaped state that doesn't fit cleanly in
 * env vars.
 *
 * No default path: V1 ships zero-config-back-compat (parent plan
 * acceptance #1), so a warren deploy with `WARREN_CONFIG_FILE` unset
 * behaves identically to today. Setting the env var is the opt-in.
