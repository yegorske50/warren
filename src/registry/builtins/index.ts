/**
 * Built-in agent definitions shipped with warren.

 * Warren seeds these into the agents registry on every server boot so a

 * Library agents loaded from a configured canopy repo are additive: a
 * same-named library agent overrides the built-in via `agents.upsert`.
 *
 * Provenance is encoded in `frontmatter.source = "builtin"` on each
 * built-in's rendered JSON. The HTTP layer reads that field to surface
 * `source: "builtin" | "library"` on `GET /agents` responses.
