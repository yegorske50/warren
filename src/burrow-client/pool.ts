/**
 * BurrowClientPool — multi-worker successor to the `BurrowClient.fromEnv()`
 * singleton (warren-41a2 / pl-9ba1 step 3, parent warren-6747).
 *
 * The pool owns the `Map<workerName, BurrowClient>` warren uses to reach the
 * physical burrow process behind each worker row in the `workers` table.
 * Today's single-container deploy boots a one-entry pool (synthetic `local`
 * worker built from `WARREN_BURROW_*` env vars); step 7 ([workers] config
 * loader) materializes additional entries when an operator declares them.
 *
 * Two routing entry points wrap the placement primitives from
 * {@link ../runs/placement.ts}:
 *
 *   - {@link placeFor} — pick a worker for a fresh burrow on a given project.
 *     Delegates to `placeForProject` (project-affinity → least-loaded →
 *     alphabetical tiebreak across `healthy` workers).
 *   - {@link clientFor} — look up the worker pinned to an existing burrow.
 *     Delegates to `placeForBurrow` (sticky-by-burrow; raises if the pinned
 *     worker is `unreachable`).
 *
 * Both return `{ workerName, client }` so callers can record the worker on
 * `runs.worker_id` / `burrows.worker_id` while issuing the HTTP call.
 *
 * The pool does not own the probe loop or state transitions — that lives in
 * step 6 (probe + drain admin API). What it does own:
 *   - constructing the local BurrowClient from env (today's zero-config path),
 *   - the {workerName → client} map,
 *   - a best-effort `probe()` that aggregates per-worker results without
 *     throwing (so /readyz can surface a degraded pool).
