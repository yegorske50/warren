/**
 * The warren-tracker/v1 wire protocol (warren-d3a9, plan pl-a37b Track B).
 *
 * The vocabulary for talking to an EXTERNAL tracker container over HTTP.
 * The extension container holds its own tracker credential (a GitHub
 * token, a Linear key, …) — warren stores none. Warren's RemoteTracker
 * (`src/tracker/remote/remote-tracker.ts`) is the only in-core speaker;
 * the published conformance suite + FakeTracker reference server are
 * warren-53ea, so design every response shape here as something a
 * foreign implementation can be held to.
 *
 * EXPERIMENTAL (PHILOSOPHY rule 4): the protocol is versioned and
 * documented, but it is not a stable contract until a foreign
 * implementation survives the conformance suite unchanged. The design
 * record is docs/design/issue-tracker.md (warren-240e).
 *
 * Shape rules a conforming server must honor:
 *
 *   - Every response body is JSON with `Content-Type: application/json`.
 *   - Capability discovery: `GET /capabilities` returns
 *     {@link CapabilitiesResponse}. `protocolVersion` MUST equal
 *     {@link TRACKER_PROTOCOL_VERSION}; a mismatch is a boot-time
 *     failure on warren's side, not a per-call one.
 *   - Base contract: `GET /issues/{id}`, `GET /issue-statuses`,
 *     `POST /issues/{id}/close` (idempotent — closing an already-closed
 *     issue is 200, never an error).
 *   - Optional surfaces exist only when the corresponding capability
 *     flag is `true`: `GET /plans` + `GET /plans/{id}`
 *     (supportsPlans), `POST /issues/{id}/metadata`
 *     (supportsMetadata), `GET /scheduled-issues`
 *     (supportsScheduledIssues).
 *   - Errors: any non-2xx response carries {@link TrackerErrorResponse}
 *     with a machine-readable `error.code`. `issue_not_found` is the
 *     one reserved code; warren maps it to `IssueNotFoundError` and
 *     every other code to a `TrackerError`.
 *   - Statuses: every issue `status` field carries one of warren's
 *     `IssueStatus` values — `open` (claimable), `closed` (finished),
 *     `other` (anything in between). The server folds its own states
 *     onto them, because only the server knows whether its `Done`,
 *     `Resolved` or `Removed` is terminal; the bridge cannot guess and
 *     rejects any other string as a malformed payload.
 *   - Timestamps cross the wire as ISO-8601 strings; the bridge
 *     converts to `Date`.
 *
 * Auth: warren sends `Authorization: Bearer <token>` on every request
 * when the operator configured one (`.warren/config.yaml`
 * `tracker.tokenEnv`, read from warren's environment — never persisted).
 * A server MAY reject with 401; warren surfaces that as a `TrackerError`.
