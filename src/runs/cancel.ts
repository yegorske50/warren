/**
 * `cancelRun` — SPEC §8.1 `POST /runs/:id/cancel`.
 *
 * Forwards a graceful cancel to burrow's `POST /runs/:burrow_run_id/cancel`
 * and emits a `cancel.requested` audit event on the warren run's event log.
 *
 * State transitions are deliberately *not* performed here directly. Reap
 * is the only path that takes a non-terminal warren run to a terminal
 * state, because the terminal transition is paired with the mulch merge,
 * seeds-close mirror, and branch push. If `cancelRun` finalized the row
 * inline, reap would skip those sub-steps via its `isTerminal`
 * short-circuit, and the operator would silently lose the agent's
 * partial work. The pipeline is:
 *
 *   warren cancelRun → burrow cancels run → reap finalizes warren row.
 *
 * The cancel response from burrow already carries the burrow run's
 * post-cancel state. When that state is in {succeeded, failed, cancelled}
 * — the typical case for a graceful cancel — `cancelRun` calls reap
 * inline rather than waiting for an external scheduler (warren-a69a).
 * If burrow returns a non-terminal state (rare, only seen if the agent
 * is mid-graceful-shutdown), the in-stream terminal detector in
 * `bridgeRunStream` will catch the eventual terminal event and reap
 * from there.
 *
 * Two corner cases bypass burrow:
 *   1. The run is already terminal. Burrow's cancel is itself idempotent
 *      (200 with the current row), but warren can answer locally without
 *      a wire call.
 *   2. The run is queued and has no `burrow_run_id`. This is the partial
 *      spawn window: a burrow was provisioned but `POST /burrows/:id/runs`
 *      never landed (or rolled back). The warren row is queued with
 *      burrow_run_id = null. There is nothing remote to cancel, so the
 *      warren row is transitioned queued → cancelled directly. Bypasses
 *      the reap pipeline because there's no burrow_run_id to read events
 *      from. Idempotent against a concurrent spawn rollback because
 *      the state-machine guard catches the race.
 *
 * Errors from burrow (`BurrowError`) and the transport layer
 * (`BurrowUnreachableError`) pass through unchanged so the HTTP route can
 * map them onto the response envelope.
