/**
 * Bridge burrow's per-run event stream into warren's events table and
 * fan-out broker (SPEC §4.3 step 5, §9 "event durability rationale").
 *
 * The bridge is the only writer to `events` (rows always land via
 * `bridgeRunStream` → `EventsRepo.append`); the broker is published
 * to immediately after each row commits so live tailers see fresh
 * events without waiting on a polling interval.
 *
 * Resume semantics. Burrow's `runs.stream` always tails from the start
 * of the burrow's event history (the route doesn't accept `?since=`
 * for the run-scoped variant), so warren dedupes on the consumer side:
 * `EventsRepo.maxSeqForRun(runId)` gives the last seq we persisted, and
 * any incoming event whose `seq <= maxSeq` is dropped. This is the
 * "MAX(events.burrow_event_seq) + 1" recovery point in SPEC §4.3 — we
 * implement it client-side because the wire route doesn't.
 *
 * The bridge swallows transport-layer errors (BurrowUnreachableError
 * et al.) and just returns; it logs the failure if a logger was
 * supplied. The supervising layer (Phase 9 HTTP server, Phase 12
 * supervisor) is responsible for restart policy.
 *
 * State mirroring is intentionally limited to the queued → running
 * edge: as soon as the bridge sees its first event from burrow, it
 * atomically claims the warren row via `RunsRepo.claimById` so HTTP
 * clients polling `/runs/:id` stop seeing 'queued' while the agent is
 * actively working. Terminal transitions still belong to Phase 7
 * (reap); the bridge never finalizes a run.
 *
 * Terminal detection (warren-a69a). Burrow's run-stream is an infinite
 * poll on the events table — it never auto-closes when the burrow run
 * reaches a terminal state. Without an in-stream signal, the bridge
 * would keep polling forever and warren's run would stay 'running' even
 * after the agent exited. So the bridge inspects each persisted event
 * for a runtime-terminal shape (claude-code: `kind=state_change`,
 * `stream=system`, `payload.type=result`); on a match, it sets
 * `terminalDetected` on the result and breaks. The registry layer
 * (server/bridges.ts) reads `terminalDetected` and calls `reapRun` —
 * the bridge does not transition warren state itself (mx-fadaa2).
 *
 * Restart recovery. `recoverActiveRunStreams` walks the runs table for
 * rows in {queued, running} that already have a `burrow_run_id`, and
 * starts a bridge for each. It returns the in-flight bridges so the
 * caller can stop them on shutdown.
