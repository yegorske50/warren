/**
 * Warren API callback env for the sandbox (warren-f248, re-scoped warren-57fd).
 *
 * Injects a callback credential + a loopback base URL into a run's burrow
 * env so the agent/finalize harness can call back into warren's own HTTP API
 * (the in-pod steering poll, the two finalize legs, and the salvage intake).
 * Without a credential
 * such calls return 401 (`src/server/auth.ts` requires a bearer token) because
 * the burrow otherwise carries only `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` + `WARREN_QUALITY_GATE`.
 *
 * The credential is NOT the operator token. warren-57fd replaced the forwarded
 * operator bearer — which granted the sandbox full control-plane admin — with a
 * per-run scoped token (`src/runs/spawn/run-token.ts`) valid only for THIS
 * run's own callback surface and only while the run is live. On a public
 * instance the sandbox inputs are attacker-influenced (issue/PR text, repo
 * contents, contributed test/build scripts), so a captured callback token must
 * buy nothing beyond the run's own inbox, finalize, and salvage.

 * `serverEnv`) as the signing secret; the server's auth layer re-derives and
 * verifies it against the same secret. Skips silently when the server runs
 * `--no-auth` (no operator token to sign with) — there is nothing to inject and
