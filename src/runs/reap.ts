/**
 * `reapRun` — SPEC §4.3 step 6 + §11.A.
 *
 * Once burrow says a run reached a terminal state, warren runs reap to
 * close out the run. Three best-effort sub-steps run in order:
 *
 *   1. Mulch merge — copy `.mulch/expertise/*.jsonl` from the burrow
 *      workspace back into the project's persistent `.mulch/`, with
 *      last-write-wins by record `recorded_at`. Same `id` + newer ts →
 *      overwrite (`mulch.record.updated`); same `id` + older-or-equal ts
 *      → drop (`mulch.record.skipped`); no `id` → append.
 *
 *   2. Seeds close mirror — read `.seeds/issues.jsonl` from the burrow
 *      workspace over the HTTP file surface
 *      (`burrowClient.http.files.read`, R-07). A 404/NotFoundError means
 *      the agent never created the file; treat as "nothing to mirror"
 *      and return 0. For any row in `closed` state whose `updatedAt` is
 *      newer than the project's row (or absent there entirely), mirror
 *      the row into the project's `.seeds/issues.jsonl` (still on disk —
 *      the project clone is warren-side). Emits `seeds.closed` events.
 *      Narrower than a full LWW merge — only closes propagate, matching
 *      the spec wording "close seeds the agent marked done". Other seed
 *      mutations ride on the workspace branch push below.
 *
 *   3. Branch push — `git -C <workspacePath> push origin HEAD` so the
 *      agent's commits (code, test edits, sd sync output, etc.) land on
 *      the project's remote. Branch name comes from burrow's record.
 *      After a successful push, reap counts commits ahead of `baseBranch`
 *      with `git rev-list --count <baseBranch>..HEAD` and surfaces it as
 *      `commitsAhead`. When the count is 0, an extra `reap.empty_push`
 *      event fires (warren-f3bb): the push command exit-0'd but landed
 *      no work — the silent twin of warren-67cc / warren-a69a where the
 *      agent never ran `git commit` (or its commit failed). `branchPushed`
 *      keeps its "push command exited zero" semantics; `commitsAhead`
 *      is the load-bearing observability field.
 *
 * Then warren's run row transitions to the burrow-observed outcome
 * (queued/running → succeeded|failed|cancelled). queued → succeeded is
 * not a legal direct transition (see RunsRepo's state machine), so
 * reap promotes queued → running first when the outcome is succeeded
 * or failed.
 *
 * Failure-cause discriminator (warren-3c40, warren-5165). When
 * `outcome === "failed"`, reap records *why* it failed in
 * `runs.failure_reason` and on the `reap.completed` event. Inputs to the
 * inference: state on entry plus the event log.
 *
 *   - `queued` on entry ⇒ no events ever flowed from burrow ⇒
 *     `never_started` (an under-specified agent prompt is the typical
 *     cause).
 *   - `running` on entry, no model-turn events ever observed
 *     (`kind=text|thinking|tool_use` on `stream=stdout`) ⇒
 *     `no_model_response`. Original warren-5165 symptom: claude-code
 *     emitted an init system event, then printed "Not logged in" and
 *     exited before any assistant turn. Generalizes to credential
 *     failures, rate-limit denials, and provider-network failures.
 *   - `running` on entry with model output ⇒ `crashed` (agent ran and
 *     hit an unrecoverable error mid-conversation).
 *
 * Callers may pass `failureReason` explicitly to override (e.g. a future
 * deadline-based reaper passing `timed_out`).
 *
 * Reap errors never fail the run — each sub-step is wrapped, and any
 * thrown error is recorded as a `reap_failed` event on the run with
 * the failing step name. The state transition still runs regardless,
 * so a reap failure cannot leave the warren row stuck in `running`.
 *
 * Idempotent: calling `reapRun` against a row already in a terminal
 * state is a no-op — useful for restart-recovery sweeps that re-issue
 * reap for runs that finalized in burrow while warren was offline.
 *
 * Every observable side effect (file IO, git push, system clock,
 * burrow client) is injectable so unit tests don't touch disk or shell.

/**
 * Infer failure_reason from state-on-entry plus the event log
 * (warren-3c40, warren-5165). Only consulted when `outcome === "failed"`
 * and the caller didn't override.
 *
 *   queued on entry  → never_started (bridge never claimed the row)
 *   running, no model-turn output observed → no_model_response
 *   running, model-turn output observed   → crashed
 *
 * "Model-turn output" = any event with `kind` in {text, thinking,
 * tool_use} on `stream=stdout`. burrow's jsonl-claude parser maps a
 * claude-code `assistant` envelope into one of those shapes per content
 * block (see burrow `src/runtime/parsers/jsonl-claude.ts`); a run that
 * dies before producing any assistant turn has none of them. The catch-
 * all on unparseable stdout lines also lands as `kind=text` — a known
 * minor false-negative in the rare case where claude-code prints non-
 * JSON to stdout before exiting.
