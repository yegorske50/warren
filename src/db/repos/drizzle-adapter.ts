/**
 * Dialect-polymorphic drizzle adapter (R-13, pl-f1be step 1).
 *
 * Maps sqlite's sync `.get()` / `.all()` / `.run()` query terminators and sync
 * `db.transaction()` callback to dialect-agnostic async equivalents — so the
 * 7 warren repos can compile against either dialect once steps 2-5 migrate
 * them onto this surface. Concentrates the dispatch in one ~150-LOC file
 * (auditable in isolation, unit-tested against both backends via `withDb()`)
 * instead of fanning the dialect handling across 56 call sites.
 *
 * Public surface:
 *
 *   - `DrizzleAdapter.for(db)` — wrap an `AnyWarrenDb` handle.
 *   - `.pickOne<T>(qb)` — single-row SELECT.
 *   - `.pickAll<T>(qb)` — multi-row SELECT.
 *   - `.runWrite(qb)` — INSERT / UPDATE / DELETE without consuming output.
 *   - `.runReturningOne<T>(qb)` — write + `.returning()`, first row required.
 *   - `.runReturningAll<T>(qb)` — write + `.returning()`, all rows.
 *   - `.runInTransaction(fn)` — atomic block; rolls back on throw.
 *   - `.dialect`, `.drizzle` — accessors repos use to build typed queries.
 *
 * ## Transactions
 *
 * drizzle-orm/bun-sqlite's `db.transaction(fn)` is **synchronous** — if `fn`
 * returns a Promise, drizzle commits before the Promise resolves, so the
 * dialect-agnostic `(tx) => Promise<T>` signature is incompatible with the
 * native sqlite call shape. The sqlite branch therefore issues
 * `BEGIN` / `COMMIT` / `ROLLBACK` directly on the underlying `bun:sqlite`
 * connection via `raw.exec(...)`. This is safe because warren runs as a
 * single Node-style event loop with a single sqlite connection: no other
 * SQL can interleave between the BEGIN and the COMMIT/ROLLBACK on that
 * connection. The pg branch delegates to drizzle's native async
 * `db.transaction(fn)`, which acquires a dedicated pool connection for the
 * transaction lifetime; the inner adapter is rebuilt with the tx-scoped
 * drizzle handle so query builders constructed from `tx.drizzle` execute
 * inside the transaction.
