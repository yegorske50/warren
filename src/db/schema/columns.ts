/**
 * Dialect-agnostic schema constants shared between the SQLite and Postgres
 * physical schemas (R-13, pl-f17e step 2).
 *
 * Drizzle has no shared sqlite/pg table builder — pg-core's `pgTable` and
 * sqlite-core's `sqliteTable` are different modules with different column
 * functions. The shared layer therefore lives at the metadata level: enum
 * tuples, type unions, and table/index name strings that both physical
 * schemas import. Drift between the two schemas is caught by
 * `src/db/schema/drift.test.ts` (acceptance #6).
 *
 * Repos and consumers continue to import from `../db/schema.ts`, which
 * re-exports these constants alongside the SQLite tables (today's runtime).
 * Step 3 (warren-a66e) adds dialect-aware `openDatabase`; until then, the
 * Postgres tables exist but are unused at runtime.

/**

 * `state:failed` alone can't tell several different failure shapes apart.
 * Reap infers from the warren state on entry plus event content:
 *
 *   - still `queued` on entry ⇒ no events ever flowed from burrow ⇒
 *     `never_started` (config/runtime issue, e.g. under-specified prompt).
 *   - `running` on entry but events table holds no model-turn output
 *     (`text` / `thinking` / `tool_use` on stdout) ⇒ `no_model_response`
 *     (typically a credential/auth failure — the original warren-5165
 *     symptom was claude-code emitting an init system event then exiting
 *     with "Not logged in" before any assistant turn — but also covers
 *     rate-limit and provider-network failures).
 *   - `running` on entry with model output ⇒ `crashed` (agent ran and
 *     hit an unrecoverable error mid-conversation).
 *   - `timed_out` (warren-285d) is set by the heartbeat watchdog
 *     (src/runs/watchdog.ts) when a `running` run goes silent-but-busy
 *     past `WARREN_RUN_HEARTBEAT_TIMEOUT_MS` — e.g. a runaway gate command
 *     behind a stuck bash tool. The watchdog cancels the burrow run and
 *     reaps it `failed` so the sandbox process tree is torn down instead
 *     of pinning CPU forever. burrow itself reports no separate timeout
 *     state, so warren owns the deadline.
 *   - `burrow_run_lost` (warren-b1a9) means burrow returned 404 for the
 *     run's `burrow_run_id` — typically a warren-machine restart that
 *     wiped burrow's in-memory run state. The reconciler (bootBridges)
 *     and the bridge's mid-stream 404 catch both mark the warren row
 *     `failed` with this reason instead of looping forever.
 *   - `dropped_commit` (warren-72b9) means reap's `git push` landed zero
 *     commits ahead of the base branch (`reap.empty_push`) AND the
 *     workspace tree was still dirty at reap — the agent edited/staged
 *     work but never ran `git commit` (the common weak-model failure,
 *     e.g. Gemini Flash narrating "before committing" then exiting).
 *     Distinguished from a deliberate no-op (clean tree, zero commits)
 *     which stays `succeeded`. Marking the run `failed` keeps a dropped
 *     commit from masquerading as success and, on plan-runs, fails the
 *     plan instead of silently auto-merging/advancing past the child.
 *
 * Null on succeeded/cancelled rows.
