/**
 * Dialect-agnostic schema constants shared between the SQLite and Postgres
 * physical schemas (R-13, pl-f17e step 2).
 *
 * Drizzle has no shared sqlite/pg table builder — pg-core's `pgTable` and
 * sqlite-core's `sqliteTable` are different modules with different column
 * functions. The shared layer therefore lives at the metadata level: enum
 * tuples, type unions, and table/index name strings that both physical
 * schemas import. Drift between the two schemas is caught by
 * `src/db/schema/drift.test.ts` (acceptance #6).
 *
 * Repos and consumers continue to import from `../db/schema.ts`, which
 * re-exports these constants alongside the SQLite tables (today's runtime).
 * Step 3 (warren-a66e) adds dialect-aware `openDatabase`; until then, the
 * Postgres tables exist but are unused at runtime.
