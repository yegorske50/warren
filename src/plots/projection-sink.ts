/**
 * `createPlotsProjectionSink` — binds a `PlotClient` read-cache upsert seam
 * (`PlotProjectionSink`, warren-7b60) to the `plots` projection table via
 * `PlotsRepo` (warren-9022).
 *
 * The `PlotClient` (src/plot-client/) owns no `project_id` and no DB handle
 * by design — it is a per-`.plot/` facade. This adapter closes that gap: a
 * caller that has resolved the owning project (`ProjectRow.id`) and holds a
 * `PlotsRepo` builds a sink here and threads it into the `PlotClient`. Every
 * read/write the client performs then refreshes the matching projection row
 * from freshly-read git state.
 *
 * The mapping is mechanical:
 *   - `id`         ← `plot.id` (PLOT_ID_REGEX, mx-28a262)
 *   - `projectId`  ← the project this sink is bound to (the Plot blob has no
 *                    `project_id`; it lives in warren's project record)
 *   - `status`     ← `plot.status`
 *   - `title`      ← `plot.name`
 *   - `updatedAt`  ← `plot.updated_at`
 *   - `state`      ← the whole Plot blob, mirrored verbatim into `state_json`
 *
 * Best-effort by contract (see `PlotProjectionSink`): the git read/write has
 * already committed by the time we run, so a projection failure must NOT
 * surface as an error on the originating operation — the row is rebuildable
 * from git. We swallow + log at `warn` instead of throwing.
