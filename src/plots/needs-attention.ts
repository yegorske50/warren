/**
 * Plot "needs attention" signal computation (warren-d693 / pl-0344 step 9).
 *
 * Pure, side-effect-free per-Plot scorer. The aggregator
 * (`./aggregate.ts`) fans out across every `hasPlot=true` project,
 * gathers a small bundle of inputs (the cached `PlotSummary`, the
 * Plot's events, and a snapshot of paused warren runs grouped by
 * `plot_id`), and passes each Plot through `computeNeedsAttentionReasons`
 * to decide whether the deployment-wide "Needs you" filter / sidebar
 * badge should surface it.
 *
 * Three signals (pl-0344 step 9 / SPEC §11.O), each contributing one
 * `NeedsAttentionReason` to the result:
 *
 *   - **paused_run**: at least one warren `runs` row with
 *     `plot_id == plot.id` is in state `paused` (warren-67b6 step 1 /
 *     warren-2976 step 5). These rows have a `paused_question_event_id`
 *     and are awaiting a `question_answered` event on the Plot.
 *
 *   - **merged_pr_unreviewed**: at least one `gh_pr` attachment has
 *     been merged on the host (GitHub side) but no `decision_made` or
 *     `note` event references it after the merge timestamp. The merge
 *     timestamp is sourced from V1.5 click-to-merge state (warren-8e39
 *     / pl-0344 step 14), which records `artifact_produced` events of
 *     the form `{ type: "gh_pr", ref: "owner/repo#N", ... }` on
 *     successful merge. Until step 14 lands, no Plot fires this
 *     signal — the seam is here so the V1 contract is stable.
 *
 *   - **stale_draft**: Plot status is `drafting` and `last_event_ts`
 *     is older than `staleDraftAfterDays` (default 7). Pinned to
 *     `last_event_ts` (not `updated_at`) so an idle conversation in a
 *     drafting Plot — where every chat turn appends a `note` /
 *     conversation message event — keeps the draft fresh.
 *
 * The pure helper is exported separately from the aggregator so the
 * unit tests in `./aggregate.test.ts` can exercise it without mocking
 * the disk-backed `UserPlotClient`. The aggregator is responsible for
 * gathering inputs; this module is responsible for the policy.
