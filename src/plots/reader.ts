/**
 * `PlotReader` — full-envelope Plot read seam for `GET /plots/:id`
 * (warren-961e / pl-9d6a step 8).
 *
 * Mirrors the `PlotCreator` shape (one-method interface +
 * `defaultPlotReader` production impl + `ServerDeps.plotReader` test
 * seam) so the handler can stay disk-free in unit tests. Unlike the
 * creator this surface is read-only — no `editIntent` / `setStatus` /
 * `attach` / `detach`. Per-Plot mutation handlers in later pl-9d6a
 * steps add their own seams.
 *
 * The envelope shape matches the seed body verbatim:
 *   `{ id, name, status, intent, attachments[], event_log[], project_id }`
 * — `project_id` is added by the handler from the resolved `ProjectRow`;
 * the rest comes from the underlying Plot + its event log.
 *
 * Event ordering: events are returned in ascending `at` (ISO 8601)
 * order. The Plot library writes the event log as JSONL append-only so
 * natural read order is already ascending, but the reader sorts
 * defensively so the wire contract doesn't depend on internal layout.
